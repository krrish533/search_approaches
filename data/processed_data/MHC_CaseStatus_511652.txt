2. For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred to as per 
their rankings in the Trial Court.
O.S.No.7289 of 1996 (A.S.No.399 of 2008):
3. O.S.No.7289 of 1996 has been laid for specific performance or in 
the alternative for the return of the advance amount with interest.
4. The case of the plaintiff in brief is that the first defendant and 
his deceased wife Tmt.Indira entered into an agreement of sale with the 
plaintiff on 16.03.1987 for the sale of the suit property, for a sum of 
Rs.6,35,000/- and the plaintiff paid a sum of Rs.25,000/- as advance on the 
date of the agreement and the abovesaid sum has been agreed to be charged 
on the property and a further sum of Rs.1,00,000/- was to be paid on or 
before 15.04.1987 and another sum of Rs.1,00,000/- was to be paid on 
getting full vacant possession of the suit property and the suit property was 
subject to a mortgage in favour of Mathan Kavur for a sum or Rs.2,25,000/- 
and the first defendant and his wife had agreed to deliver the vacant 
possession of the suit property to the plaintiff on or before 30.06.1987 and the 
delivery of vacant possession was made as a condition precedent for the 
execution of the sale deed.

2013
5. Pursuant to the agreement of sale, a further sum of Rs.25,000/- 
was paid by the plaintiff to the first defendant and his wife on 18.04.1987 and 
a third sum of Rs.25,000/- was paid on 27.04.1987 and finally, a fourth sum 
of Rs.10,000/- was paid on 05.05.1987, amounting in all to Rs.85,000/- and 
on 20.03.1988, the first defendant and his wife issued a notice, through their 
Advocate, to the plaintiff alleging that the plaintiff has committed breach of 
the agreement and contended that after the receipt of Rs.85,000/-, a pro note 
was executed by the first defendant, his wife and their son and daughter on 
19.04.1987, without receiving any payment and it has been stated that in 
November, 1987, a draft sale deed was sent by the plaintiff requiring the son 
and three daughters of the first defendant and his wife to join in the sale deed 
as vendors and by way of the said notice, time was given upto 10.03.1988 to 
discharge the plaintiff's obligation under the abovesaid agreement.
6. The plaintiff gave a reply on 09.06.1988 calling upon the first 
defendant and his wife to sit over and discuss the matter as to how best the 
transaction could be completed.  However, without giving any concrete 
proposal, suddenly, the first defendant and his wife issued a notice on 
01.11.1988 giving time till 11.11.1988 to complete the sale transaction.  A 
reply was given on 09.11.1988 by the plaintiff expressing his willingness for 
7/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
registering the sale deed and also called for income tax clearance certificate. 
While the plaintiff was expecting the income tax clearance certificate from the 
first defendant and his wife for registering the sale deed, the plaintiff came to 
know that deliberately the first defendant and his wife have sold the suit 
property to the sixth defendant and the sixth defendant was fully aware of the 
agreement of sale in favour of the plaintiff as the whole agreement was 
arranged by their Advocate P.K.Gopal Raj and on seeing the construction 
activities going on in the suit property, the plaintiff contacted the Advocate 
P.K.Gopal Raj and he represented that the suit property had been sold and 
when the plaintiff referred to the sale agreement in his favour, P.K.Gopal Raj 
said that he will settle the matter amicably and that is why, the plaintiff did 
not take steps to issue a notice believing the abovesaid representation to be 
true.  The attempt made by P.K.Gopal Raj to delay the process was only for the 
purpose of saving his own acts of commission and omission.  P.K.Gopal Raj 
had written a letter to the sixth defendant saying that there is no subsisting 
agreement to sell the property in favour of anybody to enable the sixth 
defendant to get finance and the sixth defendant was made aware of the suit 
agreement by P.K.Gopal Raj and therefore, the sixth defendant is not the bona 
fide purchaser for the value without notice of the suit agreement in favour of 
the plaintiff.

7. A notice was issued on 16.10.1989, wherein the first defendant 
and his wife had falsely concocted a story as if the plaintiff was not interested 
in purchasing the suit property.  The plaintiff is a man of sufficient means and 
always willingness to purchase the suit property.  In fact, he had already sent 
a draft sale deed to the first defendant and his wife for getting the income tax 
clearance certificate.  The plaintiff even expressed his willingness to purchase 
the suit property without insisting upon the vacant possession of the suit 
property and a sum of Rs.25,000/- was retained for delivery of vacant 
possession within three months from the date of the intended sale deed.
8. A reply was given by the plaintiff on 14.11.1989 to the abovesaid 
notice, with a copy marked to the sixth defendant.  A rejoinder was given by 
the first defendant and his wife on 07.12.1989 inter alia stating that the 
plaintiff received a blank promissory note for Rs.50,000/- without payee's 
name from the first defendant and his wife and their son and daughter and 
the abovesaid averments are false.  The said pronote is true, valid and 
supported by consideration and the promisors borrowed Rs.50,000/- from the 
plaintiff on 19.04.1987 and executed the same in favour of the plaintiff.  The 
plaintiff filed a separate suit, on the basis of the said promissory note.  The 
9/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
reply notice dated 14.11.1989 has also been received by the sixth defendant. 
The wife of the first defendant died leaving behind the first defendant and the 
defendants 2 to 5 as her legal heirs and therefore, they had been impleaded. 
Hence, according to the plaintiff, he has laid the suit for the appropriate relief.
9. The first defendant resisted the plaintiff's suit contending that 
the sale agreement dated 16.03.1987 had been entered into between him, his 
wife and the plaintiff with reference to the suit property and they had agreed 
to sell the suit property to the plaintiff as they were in urgent need of funds to 
celebrate the marriage of their daughter Geetha, which was scheduled on 
02.05.1987 and in addition to the sum of Rs.25,000/- paid as advance on the 
date of the sale agreement, the plaintiff agreed to pay a further sum of 
Rs.1,00,000/- or or before 15.04.1987 and however, the plaintiff had not 
honoured his abovesaid commitment and thereby, committed the breach of 
agreement.  The amounts said to have been paid by the plaintiff have been 
made after the persistent demands on the part of the defendants.  The plaintiff 
had also obtained a pronote from the first defendant, his wife and defendants 
4 and 5, without advancing any amount, on 19.04.1987 and they had signed 
the same, without receiving any amount, under the fond hope that he would 
pay the further sum of Rs.1,00,000/- before the marriage of Geetha.  For 
10/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
whatever the amounts the plaintiff had made, he had obtained the signature 
of the first defendant and his wife on the agreement itself.
10. The first defendant and his wife issued a notice dated 
20.02.1988 to the plaintiff stating that the plaintiff had wilfully failed and 
neglected to discharge his duty as per terms of the sale agreement and also 
informed the plaintiff that they are not agreeable to execute the sale deed in 
terms of the said draft sale deed as it required the signature of their son and 
daughters and the same is not incorporated in terms of the sale agreement. 
Despite the same, the plaintiff had not changed his stand and made it clear 
that he is not interested in discharging his duty as per the sale agreement and 
finally, time was given upto 10.03.1988 to the plaintiff to discharge his duty 
and the plaintiff was directed to surrender the pronote dated 19.04.1987 duly 
cancelled and pay the advance amount with interest at the rate of 24% per 
annum from 15.04.1987 till date and sent the draft sale deed describing the 
first defendant and his wife alone as vendors, failing which, the plaintiff was 
apprised that the sale agreement would be treated as discharged and the first 
defendant and his wife would be treated as discharged from their obligations 
due to the breach of the sale agreement on the part of the plaintiff and the 
first defendant and his wife would be refunding Rs.60,000/- to the plaintiff 
11/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
after adjusting Rs.25,000/- towards damages from the total sum of 
Rs.85,000/- paid by the plaintiff till then.
11. Even thereafter, the plaintiff had not bothered to send any 
reply.  Even in the belated reply notice, dated 09.06.1988, the plaintiff has not 
come forward with any concrete proposal and has given evasive reply.  The 
first defendant had suggested registration of the sale deeds, one by him and 
the other one by his wife jointly with their son / fourth defendant in favour of 
the plaintiff or his nominee / nominees and the purchaser, namely, the 
plaintiff shall deposit Rs.25,000/- each in the fixed deposit in the name of the 
first defendant and his wife jointly with the purchaser on any Bank and the 
said fixed deposit amounts would be encashed by the first defendant and his 
wife after the delivery of possession of the entire building to the plaintiff.  Two 
draft sale deeds were presented by the first defendant and his wife to the 
plaintiff in August, 1988 for approval and obtaining income tax clearance 
certificate.  However, the plaintiff was not interested in the sale transaction 
and did not bother to approve the sale deeds and return the same and hence, 
a legal notice, dated 01.11.1988 was given to the plaintiff.  The reply of the 
plaintiff, dated 09.11.1988, would expose that the plaintiff was not in a 
position to discharge his duties.  Without sending the draft sale deed duly 
12/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
approved, the plaintiff has merely come forward as if he is ready to register the 
sale deed and thus, the plaintiff is not bona fidely interested in purchasing the 
suit property.
12. The first defendant and his wife had taken steps to evict the 
tenants from the suit property and as the mortgagee had instituted a civil suit 
against the first defendant and his wife claiming the mortgage amount, left 
with no other alternative, the first defendant and his wife proceeded to 
alienate the suit property to the willing purchaser and accordingly, they had 
sold the suit property to the sixth defendant.  As the plaintiff had committed 
breach of the sale agreement, dated 16.03.1987 and the said agreement was 
not in force, there was no necessity for the first defendant and his wife to 
disclose the same to the sixth defendant.
13. The sixth defendant had given the draft sale deeds to enable 
the first defendant and his wife to get the income tax clearance certificate and 
also discharged the mortgage debts subsisting on the suit property and after 
completing the necessary formalities, the sale deed had been executed in 
favour of the sixth defendant and possession was delivered to him.  The 
plaintiff has made unnecessary allegations against the Advocate P.K.Gopal 
13/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
Raj.  The plaintiff has never been ready to discharge his duties and the 
plaintiff has no means to complete the sale transaction.
14. The first defendant and his wife and the other defendants had 
filed the suit in O.S.No.12160 of 1989, on the file of the City Civil Court, 
Madras, for the relief of mandatory injunction directing the plaintiff to return 
the promissory note dated 19.04.1987.  On the other hand, the plaintiff had 
filed O.S.No.4149 of 1990 claiming the alleged amount due under the pronote 
dated 19.04.1987.  The plaintiff has not come forward with clean hands.  Due 
to the breach committed by the plaintiff, the first defendant had suffered a 
loss of Rs.70,000/- in the sale of the suit property.  The defendants are 
entitled to forfeit the sum of Rs.25,000/- as per the terms of the sale 
agreement and accordingly, prayed the necessary counter claim with reference 
to the same and accordingly, prayed for the dismissal of the plaintiff's suit.
15. The defendants 2 to 5 have filed the written statement 
contending that they have nothing to do with the sale agreement dated 
16.03.1987 entered into between the plaintiff and their parents.  The 
defendants did not borrow Rs.50,000/- from the plaintiff on the strength of 
the pronote dated 19.04.1987 and the parents of the defendants 2 to 5 wanted 
14/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
them to sign a pronote for Rs.50,000/- as the plaintiff insisted upon such 
signature in order to pay the advance amount.  Owing to the abovesaid undue 
influence of their parents, the defendants 4 and 5 had signed the pronote 
dated 19.04.1987 for Rs.50,000/- without receiving any amount from the 
plaintiff and the defendants 2 to 5 never approached the plaintiff for a loan of 
Rs.50,000/- on 19.04.1987 and the abovesaid promissory note is not 
supported by consideration and it is void and unenforceable.  The consent of 
the defendants 4 and 5 was not obtained freely and with reference to the 
same, the parents of these defendants and the defendants 4 and 5 had filed 
O.S.No.12160 of 1989 for the appropriate relief, on the file of the City Civil 
Court, Madras.  The mother of the defendants 2 to 5 did not leave any estate 
and the fourth defendant had executed the sale deed in favour of the sixth 
defendant in 1989 itself and therefore, according to them, they are 
unnecessary parties to the suit and the suit laid by the plaintiff is liable to be 
dismissed.
16. The sixth defendant resisted the plaintiff's suit contending that 
they are the bona fide purchasers of the suit property without notice and in 
good faith after proper enquiry and without the knowledge of the alleged 
previous agreement with the plaintiff and the sixth defendant paid valid 
15/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
consideration for the purchase of the suit property under two sale deeds dated 
22.02.1989, after discharging the two earlier mortgages in respect of the suit 
property and therefore, the suit laid by the plaintiff against the sixth 
defendant is not maintainable.
17. The plaintiff is not entitled to seek for the specific performance 
based on the agreement dated 16.03.1987.  The plaintiff is guilty of laches and 
delay and he has not complied with the terms of the agreement of sale and 
failed to perform his part of the contract and in any event, to the knowledge of 
the sixth defendant, there is no agreement between the plaintiff and the 
defendants 1 and 2 and the sixth defendant is not aware of the 
correspondences between the plaintiff and the defendants as alleged in the 
plaint.  The sixth defendant obtained financial assistance from the Tamil Nadu 
Mercantile Bank, G.T.Branch, Madras, for the purchase of the suit property 
and after obtaining legal opinion, the sixth defendant endeavoured to 
purchase the suit property for valid consideration and after the eviction of the 
tenants, the possession had been handed over to the sixth defendant by the 
vendors and therefore, the sixth defendant had acted bona fidely and honestly 
and after due enquiry, purchased the suit property and put up new 
construction in the suit property, after obtaining necessary permission from 
16/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
the Corporation of Madras and the suit property has been mutated in the 
name of the sixth defendant by the Corporation and therefore, putforth the 
case that the plaintiff is not entitled to obtain any reliefs as claimed in the 
plaint and the suit is liable to be dismissed.
18. On the basis of the above pleadings, the following issues were 
framed for consideration by the Trial Court:
i.Whether the suit as framed is maintainable?
ii. Whether the plaintiff entitled to any charge on 
the suit property?
iii. Whether the plaintiff has performed his part of 
the agreement?
iv. Whether the defendants 2 to 5 have not 
borrowed Rs.50,000/- from the plaintiff on the 
strength of the pronote dated 19.04.1987?
v. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree as 
prayed for?
vi. Whether the plaintiffs are committed breach of 
contract for agreement of sale dated 16.03.1987?

vii. Whether the defendants are entitled to claim 
damages of Rs.25,000/- as claimed in the 
counter claim?
viii.  Whether the plaintiffs are not entitled to 
equitable relief of specific performance on the 
account of laches and lapses on the part of the 
plaintiffs, as contended by the sixth defendant?
ix. Whether the sixth defendant is bona fide 
purchaser of the suit property without notice of 
Ex.A1 sale agreement?
x. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to claim 18% 
interest for the advance amount?
O.S.No.4149 of 1990 (A.S.No.998 of 2009):
19. Suit for recovery of money.
20. The case of the plaintiff in brief is that on 19.04.1987, the 
defendant borrowed a sum of Rs.50,000/- from him and executed a 
promissory note promising to repay the borrowed amount with interest as 
recited in the promissory note and despite the repeated demands and 
18/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
reminders, the defendants have not paid any amount towards the said 
promissory note.  To the notice dated 14.11.1989, issued by the plaintiffs' 
Advocate, the defendants replied through their Advocate denying the borrowal 
of the amount, but, admitted execution of the promissory note and at the 
time, when the notice dated 20.02.1988 was issued, there was negotiation in 
respect of the purchase of the suit property between the parties and both the 
parties had agreed that the amount received by way of the promissory note 
would be repaid and therefore, there was no necessity to issue a notice and 
therefore, according to the plaintiffs, he had been necessitated to levy the suit 
for recovery of the amount due on the promissory note.
21. The defendants resisted the plaintiffs' suit contending that they 
had not borrowed any amount from the plaintiff on 19.04.1987 as alleged in 
the plaint.  The suit promissory note has been obtained fraudulently by the 
plaintiff without paying any consideration and the defendants 1 and 2 offered 
to sell their property to the plaintiff and they had entered into an agreement of 
sale with the plaintiff with reference to the same and the plaintiff had assured 
to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- on or before 15.04.1987, pursuant to the sale 
agreement and the amount had been required by the defendants 1 and 2 to 
perform the marriage of their daughter Geetha and the plaintiff paid 
19/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
Rs.25,000/- as advance on the date of the sale agreement and did not pay 
further advance before the expiry of 15.04.1987 and on 18.04.1987, he paid a 
sum of Rs.25,000/- and obtained endorsement in the sale agreement and on 
19.04.1987, when the defendants called upon the plaintiff and insisted for the 
payment of advance amount as per the terms of the sale agreement, the 
plaintiff informed that unless the defendants sign a promissory note for 
Rs.50,000/- and hand over the same as additional security, he would not pay 
the balance amount.  In order to get the balance amount for the celebration of 
their daughter's marriage, the defendants signed the suit promissory note 
without receiving any amount from the plaintiff and the suit promissory note 
is vitiated by undue influence and void ab initio.  If really the defendants had 
borrowed any amount under the suit promissory note, the plaintiff would not 
have waited for more than 20 months for demanding the repayment of the 
sum and the defendants had been sending notices to the plaintiff calling upon 
him to return the suit promissory note duly cancelled, however, only on 
14.11.1989, the plaintiff issued the legal notice based upon the suit 
promissory note and the defendants have filed the suit in O.S.No.12160 of 
1989 for mandatory injunction directing the plaintiff to return the suit 
promissory note and therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover any 
amount from the defendants and the suit is liable to be dismissed.

22. On the basis of the above pleadings, the following issues were 
framed for consideration by the Trial Court:
i.Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the suit claim 
amounts?
ii. Whether the plaintiff has not discharged his 
duty under the agreement dated 16.03.1987?
iii. To What relief?
O.S.No.12160 of 1989 (A.S.No.274 of 2013):
23. Suit for mandatory injunction.
24. The case of the plaintiffs in brief is that on 16.03.1987, the 
plaintiffs 1 and 2 entered into an agreement with the defendant agreeing to 
sell their property and received Rs.25,000/- as advance on the date of the sale 
agreement and the defendant agreed to pay further sum of Rs.1,00,000/- to 
the plaintiffs 1 and 2 on or before 15.04.1987.  However, the defendant failed 
to pay the abovesaid amount.  The plaintiffs 1 and 2 had been repeatedly 
demanding the defendant to pay the abovesaid amount as the same had been 
required for celebrating the marriage of their daughter and the defendant paid 
21/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
a sum of Rs.25,000/- on 18.04.1987 and obtained the endorsement in the 
sale agreement and when the plaintiffs 1 and 2 insisted the further payment 
as per the terms of the sale agreement, the defendant directed the plaintiffs 1 
and 2 to sign a pronote for a sum of Rs.50,000/- without the name of the 
payee and handover the same as additional security and thereby, the 
defendant would pay the balance amount and accordingly, with a view to get 
the balance amount, the defendant had signed a promissory note on 
19.04.1987, without receiving any consideration, believing that the defendant 
would honour his promise and pay the further advance amount based on the 
sale agreement, however the defendant paid only a sum of Rs.25,000/- and 
obtained their signature in the sale agreement and on 05.05.1987, the 
defendant paid a further sum of Rs.10,000/- to the plaintiffs 1 and 2 and 
obtained their signatures in the sale agreement and in all, the defendant had 
paid Rs.60,000/- between 18.04.1987 and 05.05.1987 and the defendant had 
failed to discharge his duty as per the terms of the sale agreement.  Hence, the 
plaintiffs 1 and 2 issued a legal notice dated 20.02.1988 to the defendant 
calling upon him to surrender the promissory note for Rs.50,000/- dated 
19.04.1987 duly cancelled.  The defendant did not dispute the same and also 
not returned the suit promissory note as demanded by the plaintiffs.

2013
25. Further, the plaintiffs 1 and 2 by way of a legal notice dated 
16.10.1989 called upon the defendant to surrender the pronote duly cancelled 
and even thereafter, the defendant did not respond immediately and only on 
14.11.1989, he came forward with a legal notice with a story as if the plaintiffs 
had borrowed a sum of Rs.50,000/- from him on 19.04.1987 and executed the 
promissory note and therefore, they are liable to pay the same with interest. 
The same had been repudiated by the defendant by way of a reply dated 
29.11.1989 and therefore, the plaintiffs have been necessitated to lay the suit 
against the defendant for appropriate relief.
26. The defendant resisted the plaintiffs' suit contending that the 
suit laid by the plaintiffs is not maintainable either in law or on facts.  The 
defendant had filed a suit in O.S.No.4149 of 1990 against the plaintiffs in 
respect of the suit promissory note and only to avoid the payment under the 
suit promissory note, the plaintiffs have come forward with the false case and 
further putforth the case that the suit for specific performance has also been 
laid for enforcing the sale agreement entered into between the plaintiffs and 
the defendant and therefore, contended that the matter is already seized by 
the concerned Courts and therefore, there is no question of surrendering the 
23/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
promissory note duly cancelled as claimed by the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs' 
suit has become infructuous and the same is liable to be dismissed.
27. On the basis of the above pleadings, the following issues were 
framed for consideration by the Trial Court:
i.Whether the suit is maintainable?
ii. Whether the claim of the plaintiffs for delivery of 
pronote mentioned in the plaint by way of 
mandatory injunction is sustainable?
iii.  What are the reliefs due to the parties?
28. Inasmuch as common issues were involved in the abovesaid 
three suits, the abovesaid three suits were jointly tried and common evidence 
was recorded in O.S.No.7289 of 1996 and the evidence recorded in 
O.S.No.7289 of 1996 has been treated as evidence in the other two cases.
29. In support of the plaintiffs' case, P.W.1 was examined and 
Exs.A1 to A15 were marked.  On the side of the defendants, D.Ws.1 and 2 
were examined and Exs.B1 to B25 were marked.

30. On a consideration of the oral and documentary evidence 
adduced by the respective parties and the submissions made, the Trial Court 
was pleased to decline the relief of specific performance prayed for by the 
plaintiff in O.S.No.7289 of 1996 and granted the alternative relief of the refund 
of Rs.85,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of the 
plaint till the date of realization with proportionate costs and dismissed the 
suit in O.S.No.12160 of 1989 with costs and decreed the suit in O.S.No.4149 
of 1990 for the principal amount of Rs.50,000/- with interest at the rate of 
12% per annum from the date of the pronote till the date of the realization 
with proportionate costs.  Impugning the same, the present first appeals have 
been preferred.
31. The following points arise for determination in these first 
appeals:
i.Whether the plaintiff is entitled to obtain the 
relief of specific performance in respect of the 
sale agreement dated 16.03.1987 as putforth in 
the plaint?
25/46
http://www.judis.nic.in

ii. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to obtain the 
alternative relief of refund of the advance 
amount paid to the defendants with interest as 
claimed in the plaint?
iii. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the 
suit amount from the defendants based on the 
promissory note dated 19.04.1987 as claimed in 
the plaint?
iv. Whether the defendants are entitled to obtain 
the relief of mandatory injunction in respect of 
the promissory note dated 19.04.1987 as 
claimed by them?
v.Whether the sixth defendant is the bona fide 
purchaser of the suit property without notice of 
the sale agreement dated 16.03.1987?
vi. To what relief, the appellants are entitled to?
vii. To what relief the respondents are entitled to?

A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
Point Nos.1 to 5:
32. From the materials placed on record, it is found that the sale 
agreement dated 16.03.1987 has come to be entered into between the plaintiff 
and the defendants.  It is further noted that on the date of the sale agreement, 
the plaintiff has paid a sum of Rs.25,000/- as advance.  The sale price has 
been fixed at Rs.6,35,000/-.  It is found that as per the terms of the sale 
agreement, the plaintiff should pay a further sum of Rs.1,00,000/- to the 
defendants on or before 15.04.1987 and a further sum of Rs.1,00,000/- on 
getting vacant possession of the suit property.  It is also noted that the subject 
matter of the sale agreement, namely, the suit property had been subjected to 
mortgage and the sale agreement recites that the defendants shall ascertain 
the exact amount due to be paid with reference to the said mortgage and the 
mortgage debt shall be discharged by the plaintiff i.e. purchaser from and out 
of the sale consideration and the said amount shall be adjusted towards the 
sale consideration.  Further, the sale agreement also recites that the 
defendants should obtain the encumbrance certificate as well as pay all the 
necessary taxes in respect of the suit property and the sale agreement further 
recites that the defendants should deliver the vacant possession of the 
property to the plaintiff on or before 30.06.1987 and the parties had agreed to 
complete the sale transaction within six months.
27/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
33. Admittedly, it is found that the plaintiff has not paid the 
further sum of Rs.1,00,000/- or or before 15.04.1987 as stipulated in the sale 
agreement.  From the pleas putforth by the respective parties and the 
materials placed on record, it is seen that the plaintiff, in pursuance of the 
sale agreement, had paid a further sum of Rs.25,000/- on 18.04.1987 and a 
further sum of Rs.25,000/- on 27.04.1987 and finally, a sum of Rs.10,000/- 
on 05.05.1987.  Thus, inclusive of the advance amount of Rs.25,000/- paid on 
the date of the sale agreement, it is seen that in all, the plaintiff has paid only 
a sum of Rs.85,000/- pursuant to the sale agreement.  Thus, it is evident that 
as rightly determined by the Trial Court, the plaintiff had not paid the sum of 
Rs.1,00,000/- on or before 15.04.1987.  Further, it is also seen that the 
defendants are unable to deliver the vacant possession of the suit property on 
or before 30.06.1987 and the defendants were able to get the vacant 
possession only on 21.02.1989.  Therefore, it is equally found that the 
defendants were also unable to comply with terms of the sale agreement as 
agreed to by them.
34. The plaintiff would putforth the case that the defendants have 
also failed to obtain the income tax clearance certificate for proceeding further 
with the sale transaction and with reference to the approval of the sale deeds, 
28/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
as rightly found by the Trial Court, both parties blame each other contending 
that they had approved the draft sale deeds, however, the facts remain that 
with reference to the approval of the draft sale deeds by the respective parties, 
there is no clear material other than the contra averments putforth by the 
each party against the other.  Thus, it is seen that the Trial Court has rightly 
determined that both the plaintiff and the defendants had committed the 
breach of the terms of the sale agreement and resultantly, the sale agreement 
could not be proceeded further.
35. Now, according to the defendants, they had been repeatedly 
demanding the plaintiff to pay further sum of Rs.1,00,000/- on or before 
15.04.1987 as they were to celebrate the marriage of their daughter.  However, 
it is putforth by them that the plaintiff directed them to sign a promissory note 
for a sum of Rs.50,000/- on 19.04.1987 and handover the same by way of 
additional security without the name of the payee and on that, he would pay 
the further sum as per the terms of the sale agreement.  On that promise, it is 
the case of the defendants that particularly with a view to secure the balance 
amount, they had duly signed a promissory note for Rs.50,000/- without the 
name of the payee and handed over the same to the plaintiff on 19.04.1987 
believing that the plaintiff would honour his promise in paying the sum as per 
29/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
the terms of the sale agreement dated 16.03.1987.  Therefore, according to the 
defendants, the promissory note dated 19.04.1987, marked as Ex.A13, is 
devoid of consideration and that no amount had been passed under the same 
and therefore, putforth the case that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover any 
amount on the basis of the same.
36. Per contra, according to the plaintiff, the defendants had 
borrowed a sum of Rs.50,000/- from him on 19.04.1987 and executed the 
promissory note promising to repay the said amount with interest as recited 
therein on demand and thereafter, they had failed to pay the same, despite the 
legal notice and repeated demands and hence, according to him, the suit in 
O.S.No.4149 of 1990 has been laid.
37. Seeking the return of the abovesaid promissory note from the 
plaintiff, the defendants have levied the suit against the plaintiff in 
O.S.No.12160 of 1989.
38. It is, thus, found that the promissory note / Ex.A13 has come 
into existence after the sale agreement dated 16.03.1987 marked as Ex.A1 
had been executed between the parties.  As rightly held by the Trial Court, if 
30/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
really the defendants had not borrowed any sum under the promissory note / 
Ex.A13, as to why they had executed the promissory note in favour of the 
plaintiff, no proper explanation is forthcoming on the part of the defendants. 
When on the date of the execution of the promissory note, the sale agreement 
/ Ex.A1 is in force and when as per the terms of the sale agreement, the 
plaintiff is bound to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- to the defendants on or before 
15.04.1987, in such view of the matter, the defendants should have 
endeavoured to secure the said amount from the plaintiff and on his failure to 
honour the same, the defendants should have proceeded further to cancel the 
agreement of sale as per law.  On the other hand, to say that for securing the 
amount of Rs.1,00,000/- agreed to be paid by the plaintiff on or before 
15.04.1987, under Ex.A1 sale agreement, they had executed a promissory 
note for Rs.50,000/- as additional security, as such, cannot be believed and 
accepted.
39. According to the defendants, when on the date of the execution 
of the promissory note, the plaintiff is liable to pay them a sum of 
Rs.1,00,000/-, in such view of the matter, there is no need on the part of the 
defendants to receive a sum of Rs.50,000/- under the promissory note and 
therefore, the Court should hold that the promissory note had been executed 
31/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
and handed over by them to the plaintiff as additional security.  Thus, it is 
found that even as per the version of the defendants, the promissory note / 
Ex.A13 had not been executed in relation to the sale agreement as such and 
on the other hand, it is found that the same had been executed by the 
defendants, as per their case, as additional security in favour of the plaintiff. 
But, the abovesaid case of the defendants, as held by the Trial Court, is found 
to be totally unreliable.  If really the defendants had not received Rs.50,000/- 
under the promissory note on 19.04.1987, the defendants would not have 
come forward to endorse the receipt of Rs.25,000/- said to have been received 
by them on 27.04.1987 and a sum of Rs.10,000/- said to have been received 
by them on 05.05.1987 based on the terms of the sale agreement.  On the 
other hand, the conduct of the defendants in meekly admitting the receipt of 
Rs.25,000/- on 27.04.1987 immediately after the execution of the promissory 
note and endorsing the receipt of the same in the sale agreement would only 
go to show that as they had received the consideration of the promissory note 
under Ex.A13, they had not putforth any resistance in making the 
endorsement with regard to the receipt of Rs.25,000/- on 27.04.1987 and 
Rs.10,000/- on 05.05.1987 and therefore, it is seen that the plea of the 
defendants that the promissory note under Ex.A13 is devoid of consideration, 
as such, cannot be accepted.
32/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
40. The defendants, having admitted the execution of the 
promissory note dated 19.04.1987, in such view of the matter, it is for the 
defendants to establish that the said promissory note is devoid of 
consideration.  If really the defendants had executed the promissory note, 
without receiving any consideration and when the defendants had come to 
know of the unwillingness on the part of the plaintiff in not acting as per the 
terms of the sale agreement and the plaintiff had only, in toto, paid a sum of 
Rs.85,000/- and not honoured his commitments, if the defendants had 
executed the promissory note, without receiving any consideration on 
19.04.1987, immediately, on noting the conduct of the plaintiff, as rightly held 
by the Trial Court, the defendants should have endeavoured and called upon 
the plaintiff to return the same by issuing a legal notice at the earliest point of 
time or should have instituted a suit against the plaintiff for the retrievement 
of the promissory note in the manner known to law.  On the other hand, the 
defendants are found to have issued a legal notice only 20.02.1988, nearly ten 
months after the execution of the promissory note.  Thereafter, there had been 
some exchange of notices between the parties and no doubt, at the earliest 
point of time, the plaintiff had not repudiated the case of the defendants 
putforth by them in the legal notice dated 20.02.1988.  However, 
subsequently, the plaintiff had come forward with the legal notice calling upon 
33/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
the defendants to pay the amount received by them under the promissory 
note.  Considering the recitals found in the notices exchanged between the 
parties, it is found that though the parties had been making allegations 
against each other one way or the other, however, still, it is found that they 
have endeavouring to some extent to go ahead with the completion of the sale 
transaction, however, finally they were unable to proceed further in 
concluding the sale transaction.  As held by the Trial Court, the plaintiff, being 
a financier, normally would not have endeavoured to advance the amount 
borrowed from him by the defendants by way of adjusting the same towards 
the sale price.  On the other hand, if the amount had been lent on the 
promissory note, the plaintiff being the financier and anxious to receive 
interest on the same, accordingly, it is found that though the promissory note 
/ Ex.A13 had come into existence, during the pendency of the sale agreement 
/ Ex.A1, the plaintiff has not chosen to adjust the consideration of the 
promissory note towards the sale price and accordingly, it is seen that 
considering the abovesaid facts, in toto, the Trial Court is justified in holding 
that the promissory note / Ex.A13 is supported by consideration and the case 
of the defendants that they had handed over the same as additional security 
to the plaintiff for securing the further sum under the sale agreement is 
unacceptable.
34/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
41. The defendants had also contended that the contents of the 
promissory note / Ex.A13 are found to be not similarly written and therefore, 
on that plea, endeavoured to putforth the case that the promissory note is not 
supported by consideration.  However, the Trial Court has considered the 
similarities of the writings found in the promissory note and also further noted 
that the defendants having admitted the execution of the promissory note and 
when the plaintiff is entitled to fill-up the name of the payee as the holder of 
the promissory note under Section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 
and when it is not the case of the defendants that they had not executed the 
promissory note, as such, but only pleaded that the same is devoid of 
consideration, the defendants having failed to sustain such a plea, in such 
view of the matter, the Trial Court is wholly justified in upholding the 
plaintiff's case in respect of the promissory note / Ex.A13.
42. As above noted, as far as the relief of specific performance 
based on the sale agreement / Ex.A1 prayed for by the plaintiff, when it is 
found that the plaintiff has not established the readiness and willingness to 
perform his part of the contract and not endeavoured to pay the sale price 
within the agreed time and also considering the exchange of notices between 
the parties and the attitude of the plaintiff in not expressing his readiness and 
35/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
willingness to go ahead with the completion of the sale transaction and been 
taking his own time in performing his obligations under the agreement and in 
such view of the matter, it is seen that there is a complete absence of 
readiness and willingness on the part of the first respondent in going ahead 
with the completion of the sale transaction pursuant to the sale agreement.
43. As abovenoted, the defendants are also found to be not acting 
as per the terms of the sale agreement in obtaining the vacant possession of 
the suit property within the stipulated period and hand over the same to the 
plaintiff based on the same.  Thus, it is found that both the parties are at 
default in the performance of their obligations of the sale agreement and when 
it is seen that the plaintiff has belatedly issued the notice calling upon the 
defendants to enforce the sale agreement and also subsequent thereto, the 
sale agreement not having been acted upon, the suit property had been sold to 
the sixth defendant by the defendants.
44. Considering the materials placed on record, as rightly 
determined by the Trial Court, the sixth defendant had purchased the suit 
property bona fidely without the knowledge of the sale agreement, as such, 
and pursuant to the same, it is also found that he has put up the construction 
36/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
in the suit property and obtained the mutation of the same in his favour and 
in all, it is seen that the sixth defendant had bona fidely purchased the suit 
property without notice of the sale agreement.  Merely because, the 
defendants' counsel had given the legal opinion as regards the suit property 
being subjected to no encumbrance, it cannot be presumed that the sixth 
defendant had knowledge about the sale agreement entered into between the 
plaintiff and the other defendants.  Considering the materials placed on 
record, it is found that it is only the sixth defendant, who had discharged the 
mortgage in respect of the suit property and thereupon, obtained the sale deed 
from the other defendants and put up the construction and enjoying the suit 
property by effecting necessary mutations in respect of the property.
45. In the light of the abovesaid discussions, the Trial Court is 
wholly justified in not extending the relief of specific performance in favour of 
the plaintiff based on the sale agreement / Ex.A1.  Admittedly, when it is 
found that the plaintiff had, in toto, paid a sum of Rs.85,000/- to the 
defendants pursuant to the sale agreement and when the defendants had 
failed to establish that they had suffered any damages, as such, for the failure 
of the enforcement of the sale agreement on the part of the plaintiff and as 
abovenoted when the defendants are also found to have defaulted in the 
37/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
enforcement of the sale agreement as they also not performed their part of the 
contract of sale, in such view of the matter, the Trial Court is justified in 
negativing the counter claim putforth by the defendants.  Resultantly, it is 
found that the Trial Court is correct in holding that the plaintiff would be 
entitled only to secure the alternative relief of refund of Rs.85,000/- from the 
defendants with interest as determined by it.
46. In view of the determination that the plaintiff is entitled to 
recover the amount, based on the promissory note / Ex.A13 from the 
defendants, resultantly, it is seen that the claim of the defendants in seeking 
return of the promissory note from the plaintiff as putforth by them in 
O.S.No.12160 of 1989 is unsustainable and accordingly, the Trial Court is 
justified in dismissing the said suit.
47. The defendants have made a counter claim in O.S.No.7289 of 
1996.  The Trial Court has declined the same.  In such view of the matter, as 
rightly contended by the plaintiff's counsel, the counter claim being in the 
nature of the suit, though taken in the written statement, as the same is 
based upon an independent cause of action, which could also be agitated in a 
separate suit and appeal is provided against the decree of counter claim, in 
38/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
such view of the matter, according to the plaintiff's counsel, when the counter 
claim is also treated as a suit and when the counter claim has been 
determined by the Trial Court and disposed of by way of the common 
Judgment, according to him, inasmuch as the defendants have not preferred 
any independent appeal against the rejection of their counter claim, on that 
basis, according to him, the appeals preferred by the defendants are barred by 
res judicata and in this connection, he placed reliance upon the decision in 
Vediammal and others vs. M.Kandasamy and others, reported in 1997 
TLNJ 96.
48. On a perusal of the abovecited decision, it is seen that the 
counter claim putforth by the defendants being in the nature of a separate 
suit and determined by way of the of the common Judgment by the Trial 
Court, the defendants having not preferred any independent appeal against 
the rejection of the same, the principle of res judicata has to be applied to the 
same and the position of law with reference to the same has been outlined in 
the abovecited decision as follows:
“From the above decisions the following 
principles emerge:-
A counter-claim is really a suit, though the 
same is taken in the written statement.  Just as a suit 
39/46
http://www.judis.nic.in
A.S.Nos.399 of 2008, 998 of 2009 & 274 of 
2013
is filed by the plaintiff, defendant seeks a relief 
against the plaintiff on a cause of action which he has 
against the plaintiff.  It is an independent cause of 
action which could also be agitated in a separate suit. 
It is to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, defendant is 
given liberty to file a counter-claim and get 
adjudication.  Issues are suggested in both the 
original claim as well as in the counter claim, and 
both are disposed of by a common judgment.  (Or.8, 
R.6-A(2), C.P.C.says that there can be a final 
judgment in the same suit, both on the original claim 
and counter-claim).  In common parlance, 'common 
judgment' means, 'decisions arrived simultaneously in 
more than one suit tried together'.  In view of the legal 
position under Order 8, Rule 6-A, C.P.C., a counter-
claim or set-off can be made in many forms in a suit. 
But they need not be given separate numbers.  The 
counter-claim is also said to be a weapon of evidence 
and enables the defendant to enforce the claim 
against the plaintiff as effectively as an independent 
action.  As stated earlier, it is an enabling provision 
which gives a right to the defendant that instead of 
fling an independent action, he can seek that relief in 
a suit filed by plaintiff against him.  Originally, there 
was a doubt whether the counter claim filed in a suit 
for recovery of money and whehter there should be 
nexus to file cause of action on which the suit is

instituted.  The legal position is now settled in view of 
the judgment reported in JT 1996 (5) 428 (Shri Jag 
Mohan Chawla v. Dena Badha Swami Satsang).
The said decision has been subsequently 
followed by the Bombay High Court in the decision 
reported in 1996 (2) Maharashtra Law Journal page 
844 Hemraj v. Yamunabai.  From the judgment of the 
Supreme Court, it is clear that the scope of a counter-
claim is in the nature of a cross-suit for all purposes.
This view of mine is supported by the decision 
reported in (1991) Madhya Pradesh Law Journal 
page 102 Shivkali Bai v. Meera Devi.
The only difference is, instead of filing two 
suits having two registered numbers, relief is sought 
for in the same suit by both plaintiff and defendant. 
The inference is irresistible therefore, that a counter 
claim will be a suit.  It must have a cause of action 
and that cause of action can be independently 
enforced.  Necessary counter-fee must be paid on the 
relief sought for.
If the counter-claim is treated as a suit, and the 
same is disposed of by a common judgment, and if 
one of the judgments is not appealed against, the 
principle of res judicata has to be applied.  For the 
definition of 'former suit' we need look into only 
Explanation 1 to S.11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
If the decision in one suit has become final in which

the issue which has to be decided in Appeal was 
heard and finally decided, the connected suit cannot 
be appealed against, for, the same is barred by res 
judicata.  I need only refer to a very recent decision of 
the Supreme Court reported in (1993) Supp.(2) SCC 
146 = AIR 1993 S.C.1202 (Premier Tyres Limited. v. 
Kerala State Boad Transport Corpn.)  In that case, 
their Lordships considered a similar question.

In Ramagya Prasad Gupta v. Murli Prasad an 
effort was made to get the decision in Sheodan Singh 
reconsidered.  But the Court did not consider it 
necessary to examine the matter as the subject matter 
of two suits being different one of the necessary 
ingredients for applicability of Sec.11 of the CPC were 
found missing.
Although none of these decisions were 
concerned with the situation where no appeal was 
filed against the decision in connected suit but it 
appears that where an appeal arising out of 
connected suit is dismissed on merits the other cannot 
be heard and has to be dismissed.  The question is 
what happens where no appeal is filed, as in this 
case from the decree in connected suit.  Effect of non-
filing of appeal against a judgment or decree is that it 
becomes final.  This finality can be taken away only 
in accordance with law.  Same consequences follow

when a judgment or decree in a connected suit is not 
appealed from.
Mention may be made of a Constitution Bench 
in Badi Narayan Singh v. Kamdeo Prasad Singh.  In 
an election petition filed by the respondent a 
declaration was sought to declare the respondent as 
the elected candidate.  The Tribunal granted first 
relief only.  Both appellant and respondent filed 
appeals in the High Court.  The appellant's appeal 
was dismissed but that of respondent was allowed. 
The appellant challenged the order passed in favour 
of respondent in his appeal.  It was dismissed and 
preliminary objection of the respondent was upheld.

Our High Court also had occasion to consider a 
similar question in the decision reported in AIR in 
1981 Madras 282 (Angappa Gounder v. Rajavelu 
Gounder) where also the scope of a former suit was 
discussed.  Yet another decision is reported in AIR 
1983 Madras 131 (S.Kandaswami v. B.A.Murugesa) 
wherein the same legal position was reiterated.
...
...
In view of the above legal position, it cannot be 
doubted that the Second Appe al is not maintainable, 
and the same is barred by res judicata.”

49. Thus, as rightly contended by the plaintiff's counsel, the 
present appeals preferred by the appellants are found to be barred by the 
principle of res judicata on the failure to prefer the appeal against the rejection 
of their counter claim.  In addition to that, the plaintiff's counsel, with 
reference to the abovesaid position of law, also relied upon the decision in 
K.A.Perumalsamy vs. A.Kandasamy and another, reported in 2001 (4) 
CTC 297.
50. On the other hand, the counsel for the defendants placed 
reliance upon the decision Anthony Chellappa vs. Victoria Ammal, reported 
in 1999-3-L.W.608.   The principles of law outlined in the abovecited decision 
are taken into consideration and followed as applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of the case at hand.
51. In the light of the abovesaid discussions, I hold that the 
plaintiff is not entitled to the relief of specific performance as prayed by him in 
respect of the sale agreement dated 16.03.1987.  On the other hand, I hold 
that the plaintiff is entitled only to secure the refund of the sum of 
Rs.85,000/- from the defendants with interest as determined by the Trial 
Court.  I further hold that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount under

the promissory note dated 19.04.1987 with interest as determined by the Trial 
Court.  I therefore hold that the defendants are not entitled to the relief of 
mandatory injunction prayed for by them in respect of the promissory note 
dated 19.04.1987.  I hold that the sixth defendant is the bona fide purchaser 
without the notice of the sale agreement dated 16.03.1987.  Accordingly, the 
point Nos.1 to 5 are answered.
Point Nos.6 & 7:
52. For the reasons aforestated, the common Judgment and 
Decree, dated 19.04.2006, passed in O.S.Nos.7289 of 1996, 4149 of 1990 and 
12160 of 1989, on the file of the II Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai, 
are confirmed.  Resultantly, all the first appeals are dismissed with costs. 
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions, if any, are closed.
