4.  The defendant was also involved in similar business of online 
matrimonial services which is over lapping with the plaintiff's business. 
It is the case of the plaintiff that use of its  well known trademarks as 
keywords/adwords for the purpose of business promotion and 
customer solicitation and for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and 
Search Engine Marketing (SEM) by the defendant is intentional, 
malafide and tainted.  The conduct of the defendant is nothing but an 
unfair trade practice and against the standards of business ethics.

5 .  It is the further contention of the applicant that when one 
searches on the search engine, Google, by inserting the key word 
“KERALA MATRIMONY”, the website of the respondent appears in the 
search result with the title “KERALA MATRIMONY” and by clicking on 
the link, it directs the user to the website of the defendant in which the 
respondent again misleadingly advertises the applicant's trademark 
“KERALA MATRIMONY” in their webpage so as to completely deceive 
the Internet users.  The above facts show that the respondent has 
optimised his website with SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by using 
the registered trademarks of the applicant and is bidding for the 
plaintiff's registered trademarks to advertise as SEM (Search Engine 
Marketing), as a tool for its SEO and in its webpages illegally so as to 
increase the visibility of the respondent's website in search engines to 
the specific keywords of the applicant.  Such use by the respondent 
also amounts to trademark violation of the applicant.  The respondent 
also opt to use other terms such as kalyan, alliance, marriage, 
Vivaham, wedding etc., to optimise its website for the search engines 
and in the adtext for paid advertisements.  Hence all the applications 
have filed for interim injunction.

6.  The primary contention of the respondent in the counter is 
that the suit is not maintainable that Google has to be made as a 
party. The alleged registrations of the applicant do not deserve to 
remain in the register and is liable to be cancelled.  The respondent 
who is in offering matrimonial services which are specific to language, 
region, caste based, cannot be forced to give up on words that are 
generic and are most appropriate to describe their services.  
7. Mr. Aravind Pandian learned senior counsel appearing for the 
applicant / plaintiff submitted that in the earlier round of litigation this 
court has held that although the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction, 
they would not interfere with the order of the Learned Single Judge on 
account of the undertaking given by google at the interlocutory stage 
that it would not permit the use of any trademarked term in the 
adwords program. In the appeal challenging the above order by the 
defendants the Hon’ble Supreme Court was not inclined to interfere 
with the order of the division bench of this court. It is his contention 
the use of competitors trademark either explicitly ie., in the domain

name or ad text or in the background of as meta tags or key words, 
causes initial interest confusion by diverting consumer traffic from the 
website of the legitimate trademark owner. The use of another trader’s 
mark in meta tags and by other background means has been deemed 
as a violation of the trade mark owner’s rights by Indian courts. It is 
his further contention that infringement can be based on confusion 
that initial customers interest, even though no actual sale is finally 
completed as a result of the confusion. It is  evident when  one 
searches for the plaintiff’s brand such as “Tamil Matrimony”’, one of 
the defendants advertisement also show up along with the plaintiff’s 
website. When customer hit a link to one of the defendant’s website 
and notices that similar services are being offered, such a consumer 
will not go in specific search of the plaintiff’s website, especially after 
having found a competitor’s website that offers similar services. 
Therefore the purpose of using the plaintiff’s trademarks are only as 
“trigger” for the defendants advertisements, which is sought to be 
camouflaged as descriptive use and intended to act as “springboard” to 
enable the defendants to illegally divert the users searching for the 
plaintiff and their trademarks.

8. The Learned senior Counsel further submits that the trade mark 
used in the code as a keyword is invisible to the end-user or customer. 
Such use, though invisible to the customer, is illegal. Such use is 
deliberate, and is done in order to increase the hits for the defendants’ 
website. It is his contention the arguments of the defendants are 
entirely based on self serving presumptions. owing to the extensive 
use of the subject marks for the last few decades, the subject mark 
have come to be associated solely with the plaintiff and have granted 
significant goodwill and reputation of which the defendants are taking 
undue advantage. His further submission that “ if the proprietor is the 
prior user of the trademark, and if such trademark is applied by a 
subsequent adapter to similar goods /services such use amounts to 
passing off and he also submits that particular words even though 
descriptive, may have acquired technical signification which would give 
to them in the trade, the character of a trademark. It is his further 
contention, What in each case or in each trade will produce the effect 
intended to prohibited, is a matter which must depends upon the 
circumstances of each case and peculiarities of each trade and  the

“use” of trademark in any particular trade must be perceived in 
accordance with the specific aspects of that trade. In business such as 
matrimonial services that are largely dependent on interest platforms, 
the advertising function is a trade mark of key the use of a trademarks 
to illegitimately and deliberately divert customers away from the 
trademark owner’s website amounts to infringement. Further section 
29(3) readwith section 29(6)(c) and section 29(6)(d) would 
demonstrate the statutory presumption of confusion due to such illegal 
advertising tactics resorted to by the defendants herein.
9. The Learned senior Counsel submit that it was recognized that 
excep ting the space in between, the trademarks used by the 
defendants are identical and would cause confusion in the minds of the 
public. There is no logical explanation as to why the plaintiff’s marks 
with a space must be permitted to be used freely by third parties while 
trademark protection must extend, as the defendants repeatedly 
claim, only to the mark without the space.  Further, in this sense, the 
use of the trademark with or without a space, for bidding as key words 
for advertising the website of the defendants, will have an adverse

impact on the advertising function of the subject marks. The 
Defendants are usurping the goodwill and reputation earned by the 
plaintiff’s marks and are attempting to dilute the same by widespread 
and concerted illegal use.
10. The Learned senior counsel further submits that if the 
defendant adopts an identical/similar mark subsequently, in website 
there by diverting traffic from the plaintiff’s website, such use by the 
defendant is deemed to be dishonest and malafide. In the presence 
case, the defendants have failed to establish that their use of the 
plaintiff’s registered trademark in a descriptive sense and the words 
contained in such trademarks do not have alternatives. There is no 
evidence of any third-party use of the plaintiff’s trademarks excep t for 
the purpose of online advertising thereby usurping the goodwill and 
reputation acquired by the plaintiff and his further contention is when 
there is a judicial establishment of a proposition of law or fact between 
the parties to earlier litigation and when the same questions arise in 
later litigation, the established propositions are treated as conclusive 
inter se the same parties.

11. The Learned senior Counsel further submits that there is no 
legal basis for this argument and there is no variance in the 
jurisprudence between the online and offline marks. In the present 
case, the customer who searches for the plaintiffs mark, when clicking 
upon the defendants’ advertisements would immediately be rerouted 
to the defendant website, and may lose any interest in availing the 
plaintiffs service even if he understands that the defendant is not 
connected with the plaintiff. This this immediacy in the possible 
confusion and loss of economic opportunity in fact makes this principle 
rather apt for the present scenario. It is his further contention that the 
result are “naturally” occurring is wholly incorrect, and results are due 
to SEM and SEO activities, and any result in the landing page in either 
ads or organic results is a direct result of deliberate design. It is 
worthwhile to note that such bidding “commoditize” the plaintiff’s 
trademarks, allowing them to be bought by the defendants to act as 
contextual triggers for their advertisements. This is also directly 
contradictory to the defendants’ arguments that such use is 
descriptive, as it exposes the defendants’ intension to commoditize the

plaintiff’s trademark in order to divert fleeting customer attention, and 
gain transaction and his further submission is this practice is in line 
with the practice of the “springboarding” i.e. using the plaintiff’s 
trademark to divert traffic which would not have come on account of 
the defendants either using their own marks or other terms. Such 
unnatural advantages is done to the prejudice of the plaintiff. Plaintiff’s 
trademark have been in use for in close to 2 decades. Even is 
descriptive, the trademark have indisputably acquired secondary 
significance. The use of the plaintiff’s trademark to act as contextual 
triggers for the purpose of advertisement amounts to nothing but 
infringement.

defendants. The plaintiff by filing this suit is re-litigating and 
attempting to obtain interim injunction which were earlier refused by 
this Hon’ble court and also confirmed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. It 
is his further contention that in fact, the plaintiff has also filed 
screenshots along with the plaint filed by it, where certain terms 
entered into the google search result yield result pertaining to the 
respondents website as a sponsored link. However, the Respondent 
reiterates that it has not bid for any adword consisting of the term 
“KERALAMATRIMONI” (Without space). While so, the Respondent’s 
cannot be held liable for the plaintiff’s registered trademark. He also 
states that the plaintiff has failed to note that the entity with the best 
information, is Google Inc. Had Google Inc. be made party to the 
present proceedings, it would have been made amply clear that there 
has been no bid made by the defendants of the plaintiff’s registered 
trademark.
14. The learned senior counsel Mr.Sathish Parasaran further 
submits that the plaintiff approached this court with unclean hands. 
The plaintiffs have miserably failed to note that the earlier litigation 
resulted in the plaintiff being denied injunction by both the Single

Judge and the Division Bench. It is his further contention the 
Defendant was never a party to the earlier proceedings, and in any 
event is not bound by the decisions therein and he is not liable for the 
either infringement or for passing off in so for as any person using as 
internet search engine is definitely aware of how a search engine 
works and in any event such a person would not be deceived into 
believing that the respondents website is associated with that of the 
applicant’s. It is further submitted that the assertion is demonstrably 
false, in so for as the defendant has submitted on affidavit that it has 
not in any manner of bid for the plaintiff’s registered trademark and 
that in any event it is entitle to a bid for the words “Bharat Matrimony” 
(with space) or “KERALA Matrimony” ( with space) in so for as they are 
nothing more than a combination of two generic words and the plaintiff 
does  not have any right over the same. It is his further contention, in 
the typeset of Documents filed along with the plaint, the plaintiffs have 
not filed any document to show that the use of the words 
“KERALAMATRIMONY” (with/without space) has thrown up any results 
of the defendant. That have been only  at the time of oral submission, 
through a document that has not been filed as evidence. Therefore the

plaintiff has misrepresented the case before this Hon’ble Court. 
Therefore  The Learned Senior Counsel submitted that the present 
application is liable to be dismissed on the above said grounds.
15. It is his further contention that admittedly the matrimonial 
services offered by the plaintiff and the defendant are aimed to cater 
to the needs of millions of Indians across the world belonging to/ 
originating from the various regions of India. Hence the use of the 
words kerala together with the word matrimony on a search engine by 
internet users would definitely mean that such user is looking for 
matrimonial subject / service for Keralites or atleast those speaking 
Malayalam and the respondent which caters to the matrimonial 
requirements of keralites and Malayalis is entitles to listed in the 
search so conducted. It is further submitted that  the use of the 
keywords “Kerala Matrimony” etc. by the defendant is to indicate the 
nature and purpose of the service offered, and hence does not amount 
to infringement of the plaintiffs trademark as provided for under 
section 30(2) (a)  of the Act. Further, on account of the word 
matrimony as well as Bharat/Kerala/etc. being of non-distinctive

character as well as common to trade and genuine description of the 
services offered, the registration obtained by the plaintiff will not 
entitle it the exclusive right to use the same in view of Sec.17(2)(b) of 
the act. Therefore, the entire case of the plaintiff must stand or fall on 
the strength of its claim in relation to _ KERALA MATRIMONY_ ETC. 
that is, that defendant is not entitled to use the word kerala etc. next 
to matrimony even with a space in between. So it is his contention, for 
above reasons that the plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction.
16. The Learned senior Counsel further contended that the 
plaintiff marks are prima facie descriptive /generic and  the plaintiff’s 
trademark are a non- unique combination of two commonplace words, 
first being the names of popular castes/ communities / languages / 
geographical places, i.e. TAMIL, TELUNGU, BENGALI, GUJARATI etc. 
and the second being a dictionary word, i.e. MATRIMONY / 
MATRIMONIAL , which are synonymous to marriage or a state  of 
being married or relating to marriage. It is submitted that combination 
of generic /common words is prohibited.  The Honourable Delhi High

[(2009) 157 DLT 791] has  held that a respondent in an injunction 
application is entitled to challenge the prima facie validity of trademark 
by demonstrating that it is purely descriptive. If the respondent raises 
the plea, and the court is of the view that there is force in the 
contention, an injunction cannot be granted because the mark is prima 
facie invalid. Therefore it is his contention that plaintiff’s alleged 
trademark being non-unique and inherently non- distinctive 
combination of two common place words the Hon’ble court is well 
within its power to test the prima facie validity of the plaintiff 
trademarks for the purpose of dismissing the application for interim 
injunction.
17. In support of his contention he relied upon the following 
Judgments:

for the Respondent/Defendant in O.A.Nos.627 and 628 of 2019 in 
C.S.No.395 of 2019 submitted that in the earlier round of litigation this 
court refused to grant interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff and 
against  the defendant. The Hon’ble division bench also considered the 
undertaking given by Google India Pvt. Ltd that plaintiff registered 
trademarks will be protected by ensuring that others do not use them 
in therir “as words”.  His further submitted that defendant has never 
violated the above said orders passed by the Supreme Court. In fact 
the allegedly infringing use complained off by the plaintiff in the 
present suit was available on the defendant’s website www.shaadi.com 
at least since 2013 as apparent from the web archive of the 
defendants website. Moreover the expressions PUNJABI

MATRIMONIALS, TAMIL MATRIMONIALS, TELUNGU MATRIMONIALS 
etc. were used by the Defendant at least since 2003 and the same 
were not even challenged by the plaintiff in the earlier suit. Therefore, 
there was no occasion for the plaintiff to have filed the present suit 
belatedly and obtain urgent ad-interim/ interim injunction against the 
defendant. No equity whatsoever can be claimed by the plaintiff in this 
regard.
19. It is his further submission that free competition is a general 
rule,  whereas exclusive right is an excep tion. Advertising for a brick 
and mortor business is non contextual or targeted advertising. Online 
platform being contextual a website has to necessa rily use relevant 
keywords to remain visible and attract existing as well as new 
customers. These keywords necessa rily include the name of the 
product sold or the kind of services offered. He further submitted that 
nobody can claim immunity from fee competition, whether by virtue of 
trademark law otherwise, and because of trademark as keywords from 
search engines does not constitute trademark use. The plaintiff’s claim 
is effectively a request to the court to restrain competitors from

advertising side by side its service, regardless of the content of the 
advertisement, and thus, even if the advertisement does not use the 
registered trademark or its components, jointly or sever ally.   For the 
reasons, it is submitted that the mere display of a competitor’s 
advertisement next to registered goods or services cannot constitute 
users or infringement. Therefore, the entire case of the plaintiff must 
stand or fall on the strength of its claim in relation to – Gujarati 
Matrimony or Tamil Matrimony etc._ that is, that defendant is not 
entitled to use the words Gujarati/Tamil etc. next to matrimony even 
with a space in between. It is his further submits that the undertaking 
provided by Google India Pvt. Ltd was only for using the keyword 
WITHOUT space, i.e. the registered marks of the plaintiff. There was 
no undertaking in violation of the same.
20. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the 
plaintiff’s mark are prima facie descriptive /generic and these marks of 
the plaintiff are inherently devoid of any distinctive character because 
they describe the class of goods or services, rather than plaintiff’s 
service and the plaintiffs marks do not meet answer the question test.

O.A.No.628 of 2019 a nd A.No.5248 o f 2019 i n C.S .No.395  of 2019 
Therefore the plaintiff’s marks are generic/descriptive and cannot be 
monopolized by the plaintiff to the exclusion of others. His further 
submission that the defendant used the word Gujarat Matrimony (with 
a space ) or Tamil Matrimony etc. not to answer the question _ “ who 
are you”  but to answer the question _ “what are you”. In other words, 
defendant by using those words, does not represent that this is its 
name, but rather that this is what its website does. Such non 
trademark use of a registered trademark is protected both under 
section 29 and under section 30(2)(a). Whether this is used in the title 
of advertisement or in the body or otherwise in any manner 
whatsoever is not important, because in all these cases it is 
descriptive. His further submission nobody can have any monopoly 
over words like _ Tamil and Matrimony, whether individually or in 
combination. And his contention plaintiff’s trademarks are a non-
unique combination of two commonplace words, first being the names 
of popular castes /communities / languages / geographical places, i.e. 
TAMIL, TELUNGU, BENGALI, GUJARATI, KERALA etc. and the second 
being dictionary word, i.e. ‘MATRIMONY / MATRIMONIAL, which are 
synonyms to marriage are state of being married or relating to

prohibited. Hence in view of the above the applications filed by the 
Applicant/Plaintiff is liable to be dismissed with cost. 
 21. In support of his contention he relied upon the following 
Judgments:

22.  It is relevant to note that the earlier round of litigation, the 
plaintiff herein has filed a suit.  In the above suits,  similar applications 
37/59

O.A.Nos.1113,  1114 o f 2018 i n C.S .No.802  of 2018;

O.A.No.628 of 2019 a nd A.No.5248 o f 2019 i n C.S .No.395  of 2019 
were taken out by the plaintiff.  In those applications,  the main 
grievance of the plaintiff is that the respondent who have matrimonial 
platforms the online Internet in the advertisement service in the 
Search Engine Google by adopting advertise text which are exactly it is 
similar to the registered trademark of the plaintiff.  
23. The learned Single Judge of this Court after elaborate 
discussion, has not granted  injunction. The above judgment has been 
reported in CONSIM INFO PVT LTD Vs. GOOGLE INDIA PVT LTD & 
FOUR OTHERS [2010 (6) CTC 813].  The same issue raised in the 
earlier litigation is also almost similar in the instant cases.  In 
paragraph No.146, the learned Single Judge, at paragraph 146 has 
observed and held that the words “Tamil”, “Muslim”, etc., are 
descriptive items, indicating a race, language, ethnic group or a 
community and no one is entitled to monopolise the use of these 
words.  Similarly, the word 'matrimony' is descriptive of the state of 
marriage of a person.
24.  In paragraph 147, learned Single Judge has held that

O.A.No.628 of 2019 a nd A.No.5248 o f 2019 i n C.S .No.395  of 2019 
plaintiff is not aggrieved per se (and cannot be aggrieved) by the use 
of these words by the defendants independently and individually. The 
only grievance of the plaintiff is that when the defendants use the very 
same combination of words with or without a space in between, it 
causes confusion in the minds of the consumers.  
25.  In paragraph 148, learned Single Judge has recorded that 
the question as to whether the registered trade marks of the plaintiff 
have acquired secondary meaning or not, has to be tested only on the 
strength of the evidence let in.
26.  Ultimately, the learned Single Judge refused to grant any 
injunction against which appeal was preferred before the Division 
Bench of this Court.  The Division Bench has held that even assuming 
that the choice of the words “Tamil”, “Matrimony”, etc., in the keyword 
suggestion tool need not necessa rily have happened deliberately, but 
the combination of two words with a space in between have happened 
only deliberately.  This aspect can also only be examined at the time of 
trial by examination of witnesses  and ultimately orders of the learned

27.  SLP was filed against the abovesaid order.  The Hon'ble 
Supreme Court did not interfere with the order passed by the Courts 
below.  However,  the Hon'ble Supreme Court continued with the 
interim orders, restraining the respondents from displaying their 
names in the website of the petitioner therein in the “Adwords” 
programme of the Google.The previous suit is still pending for trial 
and in the process of examination.  Now, the present suits ae filed 
wherein the google is not made as defendant.  The entire issue raised 
in this suit based on the programme of the google.  
28. It is well settled that merely because the mark is registered, 
injunction will not automatically follow, when validity of registration is 
questioned in the written statement/pleadings.  While deciding 
whether injunction should be granted or not, a tentative view is 
required to be taken on the question of validity of registration and 
principles for grant of injunction applied.  However, final decision on 
validity of registration is to be taken by the authorities and not by the

civil Court.  Registration is prima facie regarded as valid but mere 
registration alone is not conclusive and is not binding on the Civil Court 
when the application for injunction is considered and decided.   Onus, 
however, will be on the party which questions validity or registration to 
show that the registration is prima facie and tentatively bad or invalid.
29. Though the Plaintiff has registered the trademark in his 
name viz., "Tamil Matrimony" matrimony is descriptive word. 
Similarly, the word in Kannada, Malayalam and Telugu is also 
descriptive.  In fact, all major Indian languages have registered 
as trade mark.  There is no synonym for such word.  For example 
the word  Tamil is indicating language.  Similarly, the word 
Muslim indicating religion and Kanada and Telugu also indicate 
the respective languages.  The word matrimony is only relate to 
marriage in descriptive nature.   When the words are descriptive 
in nature, merely because the registration is obtained by the 
plaintiff the same cannot be a ground to grant an order of

injunction.  The question involved in this lis is related to 
"Adwords" programme of the Google.   Admittedly, Google has 
not been made a party in this suit.  The highest bidder is given 
the top slot in the list of sponsored links.  An advertiser is 
entitled to any number of  keywords for advertising his website 
on the sponsored links, but the slot allotted to his in the list of 
sponsored links, depends upon the price offered by him for the 
keyword in comparison to the price offered by others for the very 
same keyword. Whether the use of such keywords which are 
generic name amounts to infringement or not, cannot be decided 
at this stage, since such similar issue is already pending for trial 
in the previous suit instituted by the Plaintiff.
30. It is the main contention of the of the Plaintiff that the 
Defendant has deliberately used the plaintiff's trademarks as 
keywords and adwords on the search engines.  It is the 
contention that one searches on the search engine, Google, by

inserting the keyword "Tamil matrimony", the website of the 
defendant appears in the search result with the title "Tamil 
matrimony" and by clicking on the link, it directs the user to the 
website of the defendant in which the defendant again 
misleadingly advertises the plaintiff's trademark "Tamil 
matrimony" in their webpage so as to completely deceive the 
internet users.  Therefore, the defendant has optimised their 
website  with SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by using the 
registered trademaks of the Plaintiff and is bidding for the 
Plaintiff's registered trademarks to advertise as SEM (Search 
Engine Marketing) as a tool for its SEO and in its webpages 
illegally so as to increase the visibility of the defendant's website 
in search engines to the specific keywords of the plaintiff. Such 
use by the defendant also amounts to trademark violation of the 
plaintiff. The defendants also optimized their website for ranking 
high and to increase visibility in the search results and is 
committing infringement of the plaintiff's registered trademark.

Hence it is their contention that online user would easily be 
misled to believe that the website of the defendant has been 
sponsored or is otherwise associated with the plaintiff's websites. 
Moreover, in order to maintain its visibility on the organic search 
result, the plaintiff is forced to purchase or bid for its own 
trademarks as keywords for a higher price than necessary.  The 
selection of keywords/adwords by the defendant is not accidental 
or coincidental.  To reap the benefit of plaintiff's goodwill and 
reputation, the defendant has intentionally bid in Search Engine 
Marketing (SEM) for the Plaintiff's well-known trademarks and its 
variants for increasing its visibility on the organic search results.
31. It is the contention of the all the defendants that the 
trademarks registration obtained by the plaintiff is highly generic 
expressions, it would prevent any person from marketing or 
promoting their website at all and thereby illegally retain a 
monopoly  which is against the principles of trademark law. The

user or the internet cannot be considered ignorant to the domain 
names and the websites and would go to the same according to 
the preferences and needs. The very purpose of search engines 
like google is to provide for links to the website of multiple 
owners and the plaintiff cannot find anything illegal in the same. 
The reason why Search Engine Optimisation are sold as adwords 
or keywords are not on account of their trademark status but on 
account their generic nature.  The words Tamil, Telugu, Kerala, 
and Kannada etc., cannot be interchanged or any other words 
used in their place.  Similarly the word MATRIMONY cannot be 
substituted as it is most common and competent word for looking 
for alliances for marriages.  Hence, the plaintiff cannot be allowed 
to illegally retain the said words as trademarks and prevent 
others genuinely and bonafide using the same. 
32. The Plaintiff seeks to virtually eliminate the said words 
from the purview of common usage in internet with respect to

searching matrimonial alliances which is not a mere unfair trade 
practice but is clearly against all cannons of ethics and morality. 
During the course of the argument it is admitted by the Plaintiff's 
counsel that plaintiff cannot and does not claim any monopoly 
over the word matrimony.  It is also relevant to note that in the 
reply statement to the counter affidavit the Plaintiff themselves 
have filed that they are not seeking injunction to restrain the 
respondent/defendant  from using any of the words `Tamil`, 
`Malayalam', 'Telugu', 'Panjabi', 'Assamese', etc.,in the 
combination with any word other than 'matrimony'.  It is also 
relevant to note that the word 'matrimony' the same cannot be 
substituted either as it is the most common and competent word 
for looking for alliances for marriages. Hence it is the main 
contention fo the Defendant that the plaintiff sought to restrain 
the defendant from using any of the words Tamil`, `Malayalam', 
'Telugu', 'Panjabi', 'Assamese', etc. in combination with the 
particular word 'matrimony'.  It is relevant to note that the word

'matrimony' cannot be substituted either as it is the most 
common and competent word for looking for alliances for 
marriages.  It is also to note that the keywords and adwords are 
available in the market.  The seller of the Adwords or Keywords 
are not before us, though he was made as a party in the previous 
suit.  Merely the trademark was registered said registration alone 
itself cannot be a ground to grant injunction.  Though Section 28 
of the Trademark Act give exclusive right to the use of the 
registered trademark  in relation to goods or services in respect 
of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in 
respect of infringement of the trademark.  It is seen that Section 
28 begins with "subject to other provisions of the Act" which 
includes the power to file a rectification etc.,and to plead 
invalidity of the trademark.

"60. The question posed for consideration in the 
reference: 
"Whether the Court can go into the question of 
the validity of the registration of the plaintiff's trade 
mark at an interlocutory stage when the defendant 
takes up the defence of invalidity of the registration of 
the plaintiff's trade mark in an infringement suit?" is 
answered thus: 
In cases where the registration of trade mark is 
ex facie illegal, fraudulent or shocks the conscience of 
the Court, the Court is not powerless to refuse to grant 
an injunction, but for establishing these grounds, a 
very high threshold of prima facie proof is required. It 
is, therefore, open to the Court to go into the question 
of validity of registration of plaintiff's trade mark for 
this limited purpose, to arrive at a prima facie 
finding."

"15. CONCLUSIONS: On a consideration of 
submissions and the judgments:
(i) The court can at an interlocutory stage take 
a prima facie view as to the validity of a registered 
trade mark. This view can be taken based on 
averments made in the written statement/ pleadings. 
[Lowenbrau AG and Anr. v. Jagpin Breweries Ltd 
and Anr. MIPR 2009 (1) 356]. The pleadings in this 
regard, as in every other case, has to be read 
"meaningfully" (see Begum Sabiha Sultan v. Nawab 
Mohd. Mansur Ali Khan and Ors. 
MANU/SC/1970/2007 : (2007) 4 SCC 343)
(ii) Some marks are inherently incapable of 
distinctiveness. [Asian Paints Ltd v. Home Solutions 
Retail (India) Ltd. MANU/MH/0699/2007 : 2007 
(35) PTC 697 (Bom)  
(iii) The rights under Section 28 are subject to 
other provisions of the Trade mark Act. Also the 
registered proprietor or the permitted user can 
exercise his rights if the registered mark 'is valid'.

provided it has acquired secondary meaning 
[Godfrey Phillips India Ltd v. Girnar Food & 
Beverages (P) Ltd. MANU/SC/0541/2004 : 2004 (5) 
SCC 257]
 
(v) If a descriptive mark is one, which is, 
essentially a combination of common English words 
the user of the marks has to bear the risk of, some 
amount of confusion. No monopoly can be claimed by 
the user of the mark. [Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. 
Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2001 PTC 300 (SC)  & 
JJ.R. Kapoor v. Micronix India 1994 Supp. (3) SCC 
215;
 
(vi) The mark can be impugned both at the 
stage of registration and post registration. See 
provisions of Section 9(l)(a) to (c) of the Trade Marks 
Act for challenge at time of registration and Section 
30 and 35 for challenge after registration.
(vii) If the registered mark and the rival mark 
are not identical; in other words the two marks are 
similar then the same test as in the case of passing off

35.  When the registration of Trademark ex facie illegal or 
shocks the consensus of the court, the courts are not powerless 
to refuse the injunction.  Therefore from the above  judgments 
the Court also at the time of interim relief can go into the 
question of allowing the registration of the plaintiff trademark for 
the limited purpose, to arrive at prima facie finding. Admittedly 
the word in Tamil, Kanada, Assam, Kerala and Telugu for generic 
nature.  In fact it relate to a particular language.  Similarly the 
word matrimony  is also  dictionary word and it is competent 
word for looking for alliances for marriage. When the 
advertisement was made through the virtual word in the internet 
the adwords / keywords sold by the Google, any competitor can 
enter internet with keyword.  It is also relevant to note that the

plaintiff themselves though being a registered trademark paid for 
advertisement to the 'Google' they have also purchased 
keywords. For search of matrimony arise  only those generic 
words normally used by anyone. Therefore when the words also 
generic they have no synonym for that word except using those 
words people have no choice to find out any results in respect of 
the search made related to marriage alliance. Such being the 
position the mere registration of trademark  of the generic words, 
in my view, will not entail the plaintiff to get an order of 
injunction.
36. The documents filed in the typed set from page Nos.161 to 
182, when carefully perused, the registered trademark of the plaintiff 
namely Keralamatrimony is used in the search engine, only 
Keralamatrimony will appear first and others below their link.  It is not 
in dispute that the plaintiff and the defendants are in same services. 
Once, they are paid for their advertisement, the advertisements were 
seen with the blue box containing the prefix 'AD'.  The ranking of paid 
advertisements is based on the bidding which has to be paid for

specific key words.  The plaintiff is also paying for advertisements. 
The advertisements or key words of the google even display the 
plaintiff's mark. Only if the plaintiff has paid for such key words, the 
name will appear in the links.  As could be seen from the records that 
even a mere use of the word matrimony in isolation the same will lead 
to respective links and placed according to their payments.  Even both 
Tamil matrimony used with a space, the parties who are paid for 
advertisements, their links also will be shown in the page.
37. The Google which is operating the entire programme in their 
search engine is not made a party in the suit.  The Google having 
given an undertaking before this Court in an earlier occasion that the 
plaintiff's registered trade mark would be protected by ensuring that 
others do not use them in their 'AdWords'. Whether or not, those 
policies were implemented by the google, there is no evidence. 
Further, Google has not been arrayed as a party before this Court. 
Unless the Google is made a party and policy is implemented by them, 
as long as sufficient permission is granted to all the competitors, 
plaintiff cannot seek injunction merely based on their registration. The

Matrimony, etc.  The documents filed before this Court indicate that if 
the word matrimony alone is used, different kind of links will appear in 
their ranking as per their paid amount  As long as Google is not made 
a party and people have no other choice of advertisements excep t 
through search engine, they cannot be prevented until the Google has 
implemented its policy in selling the registered trademark as Adwords. 
The plaintiff has placed much emphasis on the interim Order of the 
Apex Court stating that some of the defendants prevented from using 
Adwords programme of the Google.  It is relevant to note that even if 
the word matrimony is used, the page will show according to the rates 
paid for the advertisement.  Therefore, only when the Google is made 
a party in the suit and Google come before this Court, it can be 
ascertained how the entire programme has been made in the search 
engine and without the Google as a party, this Court cannot make 
roving enquiry.

38. It is also to be noted that during the course of the hearing, it 
was admitted by the learned Senior Counsel Mr.Arvind Pandian that 
the plaintiff cannot and does not claim monopoly over the word 
matrimony.  It is to be noted that the document filed by the plaintiff 
particularly the registration certificates, clearly indicate that the 
description of the goods/services registered also mentioned word 
'matrimony'.  In the reply to the counter affidavit, the plaintiff himself 
admitted that it reiterated and clarified that the applicant is not 
seeking monopoly      on making use of the individual word, Tamil, 
Malayalam, Telugu, Punjabi, Assami, matrimony etc. independently. 
The applicant is not even seeking injunction to restrain any of the 
words Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Assame, etc. in combination with any 
other word other than matrimony.  The injunction is sought to prevent 
the respondent  from using the words Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, 
Punjabi, Assami etc. in combination with the particular word 
matrimony.  The documents filed by the plaintiff in typed set from 
page Nos.157 to 181 in C.S.No.802 of 2017 indicate that search result 
will show Tamil matrimony and matrimony with space, the above 
search shows and Tamil     matrimony, which does not have the same

combination of words.  Similarly in page Nos.157 to 163, when 
Malayalam.com is searched, the results show the defendant site 
showing Tamil matrimony or Telugu matrimony  [with space for 
matrimony].  Therefore, the contention of the plaintiff that only when 
their trademark has been used and the defendant link shown in the 
website cannot be countenanced.  Even for using any word, Tamil or 
Kanada etc. with matrimony.  Therefore, when the competitors have 
no other choice excep t advertising their business in the virtual word, 
unless the Google which sells key words for advertisers, is added as a 
party, injunction cannot be Ordered against competitors who are 
legitimately using only the available marketing methods at present.  
39. The remedy sought for could be granted and effectively 
enforced only if Google is made a party to the present suit. The 
Plaintiff in the guise of claiming Injunction against infringement is 
trying to monopolize the Entire Online Matrimony business market 
which is against the provisions of the Constitution of India and 
Competition Act 2002. Plaintiff can claim ownership against rem only 
for the Trademarks. Plaintiff having itself used the variants of the TM

Jointly and sever ally as keywords cannot restrain the Defendant from 
using them as Keywords. Since, it cannot claim exclusive use of such 
keywords. Google using various algorithms, find various keywords that 
are largely used keywords and then put those words for binding in its 
Ad Word programme. The Defendant left with limited choice of words 
had to bid for those keywords provided by Google. Some of the 
defendants  have been using the words “KERALA & MATRIMONY” 
separately as the said keywords have in no way infringed the 
Registered trademarks of the Plaintiff. 
40. Considering the above aspects, when the trade marks of the plaintiff 
are descriptive in nature and free competition is a general rule, whereas 
exclusive right is an excep tion, online platform being contextual, a 
website has to necessa rily use relevant keywords to remain visible and 
attract existing as well as new customers and the keywords were 
already auctioned by the Google and anyone can participate in the bid. 
Without making the Google as a party, injunction is granted in favour 
of the free competitors to bid the keywords, which amounts to restrain 
the trade in its entirety. Unless and until the Google is made as a party

and the policy is implemented to protect the registered trade mark of 
the parties, injunction would certainly lead to restraining the trade. 
Therefore, considering all these aspects, this Court finds that a prima 
facie case is not made out by the plaintiff and balance of convenience 
is also not in favour of the plaintiff. In fact,  if injunction is continued to 
operate, it will lead to irreparable loss only to the defendants. 
Therefore, injunction applications filed by the plaintiff in all the suits 
are dismissed. In view of the same, all connected applications filed for 
contempt and other reliefs are also closed.
