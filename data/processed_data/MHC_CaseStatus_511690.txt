The Civil Miscellaneous Petition is filed to condone the delay of 
429 days in filing the appeal suit against the judgment and decree 
passed in O.S.No.703 of 2011 dated 19.01.2018.
2. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner 
appellants made a submission that the petitioner appellants are 
unable to mobilize the funds for the purpose of filing an appeal suit 
and therefore, there was a delay of 429 days in filing the appeal 
suit. In paragraph 7 of the affidavit filed in support of the 
miscellaneous petition, states that the trial Court passed the 
judgment and decree dated 19.01.2018 and in the month of April 
2019, the petitioners mobilized the funds and immediately applied 
for the copy of the judgment and decree on 30.04.2019 and the 
same was called for on 24.06.2019 and deposit was made on 
26.06.2019 and the copy was ready on 22.07.2019 and the same 
was received on 23.06.2019.
3. It is stated that the petitioners have no source of income 
2/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
and unable to mobilize the funds of preferring an appeal suit before 
the High Court within the time stipulated. Thus, the delay is to be 
condoned.
4. The reasons stated that the petitioners could not able to 
mobilize the fund, cannot be a valid reason for the purpose of 
condoning the delay of 429 days in filing the appeal suit. If at all, 
there is a dearth of funds, the appeal suit can be filed and 
thereafter, the deficit Court fee or otherwise, can be deposited after 
the mobilization of funds. Such conduct at least can be accepted by 
this Court. However, unexplained delay of 429 days cannot be 
condoned and such an enormous delay is to be construed as an 
uncondonable delay.
5. The petitioner appellant is also unable to explain or provide 
some valid reason for the purpose of condoning the delay of 429 
days. Uncondonable delay cannot be condoned by this Court. Power 
of discretion to condone the delay is to be exercised cautiously and 
in the event of condoning the huge delay, the Courts are also 
expected to record reasons. In the absence of any valid reason, 
3/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
unexplained delay cannot be condoned. Power of discretion is 
undoubtedly to be exercised judiciously and mechanical or routine 
approach in this regard is opposed to the very spirit of the law of 
limitation. Law of limitation is a substantive law. Filing an appeal 
suit within the time limit is the rule. Condonation of delay is an 
exception and such condonations are granted by exercising the 
power of discretion by the Courts. Thus, exercise of discretionary 
power is to be condoned cautiously and only in the event of 
establishing a genuine reasons, such huge delay can be condoned 
and unexplained delay cannot be condoned. If such delays are 
condoned, then the very purpose and object of the Limitation Act 
itself would be defeated. In normal circumstances, Courts are 
expected to follow the statute as it is. Discretionary powers is to be 
exercised only to mitigate certain circumstances, if any caused or to 
provide justice to the parties approaching the Court of Law. Thus, 
mechanical and routine approach in the matter of condonation of 
law is certainly impermissible and therefore, this Court is of an 
opinion that unexplained delay cannot be condoned and such 
unexplained delay are to be construed as uncondonable delay.

6. The legal principles to be followed for condoning the delay 
is well settled and this Court also considered the said principles in 
C.M.P.Nos.8358 & 8359 of 2018 in AS.SR.No.32087 of 2018 dated 
09.12.2019 and the relevant paragraphs are extracted as under:
“10. In respect of said contentions, the learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent cited the 
judgment of this Court in the case of Zulaiha Syed 
Mohideen Vs. D.Visalakshi Ammal & Others reported in 
MANU/TN/2222/2013, wherein the Court made 
following observations; 
“5.Before going into the merits of the case, first of all, it 
should be stated that in a case of this nature for 
condonation of delay, it is well settled that length of delay 
is not material, but the reasons stated thereof for 
condonation of delay. In other words, for condonation of 
delay, the reasons adduced must be properly pleaded, 
convincing and acceptable and explanation should be 
offered for condonation of the delay. Unless proper 
explanation is offered, the Courts could not exercise its 
discretion in the proper perspective to advance substantial 
justice. It is also settled that when a court has exercised its 
discretionary power to condone the delay, the appellate 
Court, in exercise of its discretion, should not ordinarily 
5/36

C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
interfere with such decision unless the discretion exercised 
is arbitrary and overlooking the interest accrued to another 
party to the dispute. The appellate Court should also see 
whether the trial court has taken into consideration all the 
aspects of the matter, the advantage or disadvantage that 
may be caused to the other side while condoning the delay 
inasmuch as during the interregnum, the other party could 
have asserted a vested right. With this background, let us 
analyse the merits of the rival contentions urged by the 
counsel for both sides.
6 to 11.......
12.On behalf of the revision petitioner, several 
decisions were cited. The learned counsel for the
respondents objected for relying on the decisions by stating 
that they relate to condonation of delay in filing a petition 
and not with respect to condonation of delay in re-
presenting a petition. Such an argument of the counsel for 
the respondents cannot be countenanced. Each and every 
case depends on the facts and circumstances of that case. 
Further, the issue involved in this case is whether the delay 
in filing a petition has been properly explained and 
sufficient cause has been shown for the delay or not and in 
support of the same, the learned counsel for the revision 
petitioner has relied on the following decisions:-
(i) In (Kandaswamy and four others vs. 
Krishnamandiram Trust, Karur, by its Trustees and 33 
6/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
others) 2001 (4) CTC 722 this Court took note of the fact 
that the conduct of the revision petitioner in keeping quite 
for over two years only on account of inability to mobilise 
other petitioner evidences would amount to gross 
negligence, irresponsible inactive attitude and therefore the 
petitioner lacks bonafides. Under those circumstances, this 
Court refused to condone the delay of 797 days in filing a 
petition to set aside the exparte decree. In the above case, 
this Court also referred to the decision of the Honourable 
Supreme Court reported in (M.K Prasad vs. P. Arumugam) 
(2001) 6 Supreme Court Cases 176, which was relied on 
by the learned counsel for the respondents 
(ii) In (Sundar Gnanaolivu rep. by his power of 
attorney agent Mr. Rukmini vs. Rajendran Gnanavolivu, 
rep. by its power of attorney agent Veina Gnanavalivu) 
2003 1 Law Weekly 585, the Division Bench of this Court 
held that when the averments in the affidavit are untrue, 
lacks bona fides, then the case falls within the exception to 
the Rule of Liberal approach and it does not deserve the 
liberal approach formula in matters relating to condonation 
of delay. In this case also, the Division Bench of this Court 
followed the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court 
reported in (M.K Prasad vs. P. Arumugam) (2001) 6 
Supreme Court Cases 176, which was relied on by the 
learned counsel for the respondents. In Para Nos. 14-A and 
15, the Division Bench of this Court held thus:-
7/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
14-A. In yet another Division Bench Judgment 
reported in (1990) 1 LLN 457 (Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank 
Limited, Tuticorin versus Appellate Authority under the 
Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act, Madurai and 
another) the principles relating to Rule of limitation have 
been discussed and the legal position has been stated by 
His Lordship Mr. Justice M. Srinivasan, as he then was, in 
paragraphs 14 and 17, which read as under:-
"14. .....If a litigant chooses to approach the Court 
long after the time prescribed under the relevant provisions 
of the law, he cannot say that no prejudice would be 
caused to the other side by the delay being condoned. The 
other side would have in all probability destroyed the 
records thinking that the records would not be relevant as 
there was no further proceeding in the matter. Hence, to 
view a matter of condonation of delay, with a 
presupposition that no prejudice will be caused by the 
condonation of delay to the respondent in that application 
will be fallacious. In our view, each has to be decided on 
the facts and circumstances of the case. Length of the 
delay is a relevant matter to be taken into account, while 
considering whether the delay should be condoned or not. 
It is not open to any litigant to fix his own period of 
limitation for instituting proceedings for which law has 
prescribed periods of limitation.
8/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
"17. .....Once it is held that a party has lost his right 
to have the matter considered on merits because of his 
own inaction for a long time, it cannot be presumed to be 
non-deliberate delay, and in such circumstances of the 
case, he cannot be heard to plead that substantial justice 
deserved to be preferred as against technical 
considerations. WE are of the view that the question of 
limitation is not merely a technical consideration. Rules of 
limitation are based on principles of sound public policy and 
principles of equity. Is a litigant liable to have a  Damocles' 
sword hanging over his head indefinitely for a period to be 
determined at the whims and fancies of the opponent 
(underlining is ours)
15. On a conspectus reading of the above principles 
set out in the various judgments, it is well settled that a 
liberal approach should be extended while considering the 
application for condonation of delay. Sufficient caution has 
been exhibited to note that wherever there is lack of bona 
fides or attempt of hood-wink the Court by the party 
concerned who has come forward with an application for 
condonation of delay, in such cases, no indulgence should 
be shown by condoning the delay applied for. It is also 
clear to the effect that it is not the number of days of 
delays that matters, but the attitude of the party which 
caused the delay. In other words when the Court finds that 
the party who failed to approach the Court within the time 
9/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
stipulated comes forward with an explanation for condoning 
the delay, the Court if satisfied that the delay occasioned 
not due to the deliberate conduct of the party, but due to 
any other reason, then by sufficiently compensating the 
prejudice caused to the other side monetarily, the 
condonation of delay can be favourably ordered."
(iii) In the decision of this Court reported in (G. 
Jayaraman vs. Devarajan) 2007 (2) CTC 643, this Court 
held in a case where there was a delay of 553 days in filing 
an application to set aside the decree that discretion must 
not be exercised in an arbitrary or vague manner but must 
be exercised with vigilance and circumspection. It was 
further held that delay cannot be condoned as a matter of 
judicial generosity and the right accrued to the other side 
ought to be kept in view while considering the plea relating 
to affording opportunity to advance substantial justice. The 
facts involved in that case is identical to the facts of the 
case on hand. In that case, the decree holder was 
prevented from  enjoying the fruits of the decree for about 
8 years because of the filing of one petition after the other 
by the defendants to successf ully stall the execution of the 
decree. In that context, this Court held that liberal 
approach theory would cause prejudice to the 
plaintiff/decree holder and the discretion exercised by the 
trial court to condone the delay of 553 days cannot be 
sustained. In Para Nos. 9, 10 and 16, this Court held as 
10/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
follows:-
"9. Of course, it is the consistent view taken by the 
Supreme Court in various decisions that "sufficient cause" 
appearing in Section 5 of the Limitation Act should be 
liberally considered and the Court should be slow in 
shutting the door of justice to a litigant on the score of 
limitation. When the reason for the delay is properly 
explained, the Court is to adopt a pragmatic approach to 
condone the delay when there is no negligence, inaction or 
want of bona fide on the part of the Applicant.
10. At the same time, the discretion must be 
exercised in any arbitrary or vague or fanciful manner, but 
must be exercised like any other judicial discretion with 
vigilance and circumspection. Delay cannot be condoned as 
a matter of judicial generosity. Where delay could have 
been avoided by due care and caution, the Court may not 
exercise the discretion to condone the delay. 
16. As stated earlier, delay cannot be excused as a 
matter of judicial generosity. Rendering substantial justice 
is not to cause prejudice to the opposite party. Money suit 
was filed way back in 1998 and Revision  petitioner/plaintiff 
has been pursuing the matter for nearly 7 to 8 years. The 
matter could not reach finality because of one Application 
or other filed by the respondent/Defendant. The party 
claiming indulgence must prove that he is reasonably 
diligent in prosecuting the matter. This test for condoning 
11/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
the delay is not satisfied in this case. Liberal exercise of 
jurisdiction under Section 5 of the Act would cause 
prejudice to the plaintiff/Decree holder, who has been 
pursuing the money suit for quite a long time. In condoning 
the delay, there is improper exercise of discretion, and 
therefore, the impugned order cannot be sustained."
(iv) In (Shanmugam vs. Chokkalingam) 2009 (5) CTC 
48 this Court held that the petitioner therein do not 
deserve indulgence inasmuch as the averments made by 
him in the affidavit are false and untrue. Under those 
circumstances, this Court refused to condone the delay of 
332 days in filing a petition to set aside the exparte decree.
(v) In (Oriental Aroma Chemical Industries Limited 
vs. Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation and 
another) 2010 AIR SCW 1788 the Honourable Supreme 
Court rejected an application for condonation of delay of 4 
years in filing an application to set aside an exparte decree 
on the ground that the explanation offered for condonation 
of delay is found to be not satisfied.
(vi) In the decision of this Court reported in (K.M. 
Balasubramaniam vs. C. Loganathan and another) 2011 (2) 
MWN (Civil) 741 this Court had an occasion to consider a 
case for condonation of delay of 1581 days in re-presenting 
an application to set aside the exparte decree. In that case, 
the suit was filed for recovery of money which was decreed 
exparte and the Execution Petition filed by the decree 
12/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
holder was also ordered exparte. Thereafter, the decree 
holder obtained sale certificate also and at the time of 
taking delivery of the property, the petitioner therein filed 
the application to condone the delay of 1581 days in 
setting aside the exparte decree. In that case also, a 
Petition under Section 47 of the CPC was filed stating that 
the decree is not executable. In the above facts and 
circumstances, this Court held that the delay offered for 
condonation of delay is not proper and acceptable. In Para 
Nos. 18 and 19, it was held as follows:-
18. It is not in dispute that the suit was filed based 
on a pro-note dated 01.08.1999 and the ex parte decree 
was passed on 08.09.2004, nearly 7 years back. It is an 
admitted fact that the Petitioner appeared in the suit as 
well as in the earlier E.P. No. 87 of 2005 through Counsel, 
however, the alleged petition filed under Order 9, Rule 13, 
C.P.C. to set aside the ex parte decree was not represented 
for more than four years and four months. Though arrest 
was ordered in the earlier E.P., however, as the petitioner 
evaded service, the E.P. was closed, then the present 
Execution Petition in E.P. No. 292 of 2006 was filed against 
the property belongs to the petitioner. Notice was served 
properly on the petitioner/judgment debtor and after 
proclamation of sale, property was sold in public auction. 
The successf ul bidder, a third party to the Suit paid the 
entire amount. As the sale was confirmed and Sale 
13/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
certificate was also issued, the amount deposited by the 
auction purchaser was withdrawn by the decree-holder by 
filing a petition before the Court below and full satisfaction 
was recorded. At this stage, the petitioner is not entitled to 
seek an order to condone the inordinate delay of 1581 
days in representing an unnumbered Application, seeking 
an order to set aside the exparte. It cannot be disputed 
that the length of delay is not a matter for deciding the 
petition filed under Section 5 of Limitation Act and 
rendering substantial justice is the paramount 
consideration.
19. In the instant case, it is clear that the 
Petitioner/Judgment Debtor has deliberately adopted delay 
tactics at various stages. Having appeared through Counsel 
in the earlier Execution Petition in E.P. No. 87 of 2005, 
evaded arrest and has not challenged various orders 
passed in the Execution Petitions has casually filed the 
Application before the court below to condone the delay in 
representing an Application filed under Order 9, Rule 13, 
C.P.C. and also filed a Petition under Section 47, C.P.C. 
which would show that it is an abuse of process of law, as 
argued by the learned counsel for the Respondents. On the 
aforesaid circumstances, I could find no merit in favour of 
the petitioner to allow the inordinate delay of 1581 days in 
representing an unnumbered Application, seeking an order 
to set aside the ex parte decree. As found by the Court 
14/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
below, the inordinate delay has not been satisfactorily 
explained by the Petitioner herein. While deciding the 
Petition, this Court has to consider the substantial justice. I 
am of the view that allowing the petition would render only 
injustice to the Second respondent/auction purchaser, who 
was impleaded by the order of this Court in this Revision 
and the first respondent/decree holder, hence, to meed the 
ends of justice, the Civil Revision Petition is liable to be 
dismissed, as an abuse of process of law by the Petitioner 
herein."
(vii) In (Postmaster General and others vs. Living Media 
India Limited and another) (2012) 3 SCC 563, the 
Honourable Supreme Court, while dismissing the 
application for condonation of delay of 427 days in filing 
the Special Leave Petition, held condonation of delay is not 
an exception and it should not be used as an anticipated 
benefit for the government departments. In that case, the 
Honourable Supreme Court held that unless the 
Department has reasonable and acceptable reason for the 
delay and there was bonafide effort, there is no need to 
accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending 
for several months/years due to considerable degree of 
procedural red tape in the process cannot be accepted. In 
Para Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29, the Honourable Supreme 
Court dealt with the scope of 'sufficient cause' and held as 
follows:-
15/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
25. We have already extracted the reasons as 
mentioned in the "better affidavit" sworn by Mr. Aparajeet 
Pattanayak, SSRM, Air Mail Sorting Division, New Delhi. It 
is relevant to note that in the said affidavit, the 
Department has itself mentioned and is aware of the date 
of the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court in 
Office of the Chief Postmaster vs. Living Media Limited as 
11.09.2009. Even according to the deponent, their counsel 
had applied for the certified copy of the said judgment only 
on 08.01.2010 and the same was received by the 
Department on the very same day. There is no explanation 
for not applying for the certified copy of the impugned 
judgment on 11.09.2009 or at least within a reasonable 
time. The fact remains that the certified copy was applied 
for only on 08.01.2010 i.e., after a period of nearly four 
months.
26. In spite of affording another opportunity to file 
better affidavit by placing adequate material, neither the 
Deponent nor the person-in-charge has filed any 
explanation for not applying the certified copy within the 
prescribed period. The other dates mentioned in the 
affidavit which we have already extracted, clearly show 
that there was delay at every stage and except mentioning 
the dates of receipt of the file and the decision taken, there 
is no explanation as to why such delay had occasioned. 
Though it was stated by the Department that the delay was 
16/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
due to unavoidable circumstances and genuine difficulties, 
the fact remains that from day one the Department or the 
person/persons concerned have not evinced diligence in 
prosecuting the matter to this Court by taking appropriate 
steps.
27. It is not in dispute that the person (s) concerned 
were well aware or conversant with the issues involved 
including the prescribed period of limitation for taking up 
the matter by way of filing a special leave petition in this 
Court. They cannot claim that they have a separate period 
of limitation when the Department was possessed  with 
competent persons familiar with court proceedings. In the 
absence of plausible and acceptable explanation, we are 
posing a question why the delay is to be condoned 
mechanically merely because the Government or a wing of 
the Government is a party before us. 
28. Though we are conscious of the fact that in a 
matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross 
negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides, a 
liberal concession has to be adopted to advance substantial 
justice, we are of the view that in the facts and 
circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of 
various earlier decisions. The claim on account of 
impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic 
methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted 
in view of the modern technologies being used and 
17/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds 
everybody, including the Government. 
29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the 
government bodies, their agencies and instrumentalities 
that unless they have reasonable and acceptable 
explanation for the delay and there was bona fide effort, 
there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the 
file was kept pending for several months/years due to 
considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process. 
The government departments are under a special 
obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with 
diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an 
excep tion and should not be used as an anticipated benefit 
for the government departments. The law shelters 
everyone under the same light and should not be swirled 
for the benefit of a few."
11.In the case of Sundar Gnanaolivu Vs. Rajendran 
Gnanavolivu reported in MANU/TN/2123/2003, the 
Division Bench made following observations;
“8. In the judgment reported in MANU/SC/0573/1998 
: 1998 (2) CTC 533 (N. Balakrishnan versus M. 
Krishnamurthy), the position has been set out as under in 
para 14:
14. It must be remembered that in every case of delay 
18/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
there can be some lapse 'on the part of the litigant 
concerned.
That alone is not enough to turn down his plea and to shut 
the door against him. If the explanation does not smack of 
mala fides or it is put-forth as part of a dilatory strategy 
the court must show utmost consideration to the suitor. 
But when there is reasonable ground to think that the 
delay was occasioned by the party deliberately to gain time 
then the court should lean against acceptance of the 
explanation....
(Underlining is ours)
9. In the Judgment reported in MANU/SC/0398/2001 : 
2001(6) SCC 176 M.K. Prasad versus P. Arumugam), it has 
been held as under in para 9.
9.Again in State of W.B. v. Administrator, Howrah 
Municipality and G. Ramegowda Major v. Special Land 
Acquisition Officer this Court observed that the expression 
"sufficient cause" in Section 5 of the Limitation Act must 
receive a liberal construction so as to advance substantial 
justice and generally delays be condoned in the interest of 
justice where gross negligence or deliberate inaction or 
lack of bona fides is not imputable to the party seeking 
condonation of delay. Law of limitation has been enacted to 
serve the interests of justice and not to defeat it. Again in 
N. Balakrishnan v. M. Krishnamurthy this Court held that 
acceptability of explanation for the delay is the sole

criterion and length of delay is not relevant, in the absence 
of anything showing mala fide or deliberate delay as a 
dilatory tactic, the court should normally condone the 
delay....

10.In a recent Judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court 
reported in MANU/SC/0135/2002 : 2002(3) SCC 195 = 
2002-3-L.W.417 (Ram Nath Sao @ Ram Sahu & Others 
versus Gobardhan Sap & Others), the position has been 
succinctly set out in para 12 which reads as under:
12. ...Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the 
rule and refusal, an excep tion, more so when no negligence 
or inaction or want of bona fides can be imputed to the 
defaulting party. On the other hand, while considering the 
matter the courts should not lose sight of the fact that by 
not taking steps within the time prescribed a valuable right 
has accrued to the other party which should not be lightly 
defeated by condoning delay in a routine-like manner....

11. In the Division Bench Judgment of our High Court, in 
the Judgment reported in MANU/TN/0252/2000 : 2000 (3) 
CTC 727 = 2000 3 L.W. 938 (C. Subraniam versus Tamil 
Nadu Housing Board rep. by its Chairman And Managing 
Director), the position has been stated as under in para 31:
31. To turn up the legal position, (1) the work "sufficient 
cause" should receive liberal construction to do substantial 
20/36

C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
justice; (2) what is "sufficient cause" is a question of fact in 
a given circumstances of the case; (3) it is axiomatic that 
condonation of delay is discretion of the Court; (4) length 
of delay is no matter, but acceptability of the explanation is 
the only criterion' (5) once the Court accepts the 
explanation as "sufficient", it is the result of positive 
exercise of discretion and normally the superior court 
should not disturb in such finding unless the discretion was 
exercised on wholly untenable or perverse; (6) The rules of 
limitation are not meant to destroy the rights of the parties 
but they are meant to see that the parties do not resort to 
dilatory tactics to seek their remedy promptly; (7) Unless a 
party shows that he/she is put to manifest injustice or 
hardship, the' discretion exercised by the lower Court is not 
liable to be revised; (8) If the explanation does not smack 
of mala fides or it is put forth as part of a dilatory strategy, 
the court must show utmost consideration to the suitor; 
(9). If the delay was occasioned by party deliberately to 
gain time, then the court should lean against acceptance of 
the explanation and while condoning the delay, the Court 
should not forget the opposite party altogether.
13. In yet another Division Bench Judgment reported in 
1990 (1) LLN 457 (Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank Ltd. 
Tuticorin versus Appellate Authority Under The Tamil Nadu 
Shops And Establishments Act, Madurai And Another), the 
principles relating to rule of limitation have been discussed 
21/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
and the legal position has been stated by His Lordship Mr. 
Justice M. Srinivasan, as he then was, in paragraphs 14 
and 17 which read as under:
14. ...If a litigant chooses to approach the Court long after 
the time prescribed under the relevant provisions of the 
law, he cannot say that no prejudice would be caused to 
the other side by the delay being condoned. The other side 
would have in all probability destroyed the records thinking 
that the records would not be relevant as there was no 
further proceeding in the matter. Hence to view a matter of 
condonation of delay with a presupposition that no 
prejudice will be caused by the condonation of delay to the 
respondent in that application will be fallacious. In our 
view, each case has to be decided on the facts and 
circumstances of the case. Length of the delay is a relevant 
matter to be taken into account while considering whether 
the delay should be condoned or not. It is not open to any 
litigant to fix his own period of limitation for instituting 
proceedings for which law has prescribed periods of 
limitation.
17. ...Once it is held that a party has lost his right to have 
the matter considered on merits because of his own 
inaction for a long time, it cannot be presumed to be non-
deliberate delay, and in such circumstances of the case, he 
cannot be heard to plead that substantial justice deserved 
to be preferred as against technical considerations. We are 
22/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
of the view that the question of limitation is not merely a 
technical consideration. Rules of limitation are based on 
principles of sound public policy and principles of equity. Is 
a litigant liable to have a Damocles' sword hanging over his 
head indefinitely for a period to be determined at the 
whims and fancies of the opponent?
(Underlining is ours)
14. On a conspectus reading of the above principles set out 
in the various judgments, it is well settled that a liberal 
approach should be extended while considering the 
application for condonation of delay. Sufficient caution has 
been exhibited to note that wherever there is lack of bona 
fides or attempt to hood-wink the Court by the party 
concerned who has come forward with an application for 
condonation of delay, in such cases, no indulgence should 
be shown by condoning the delay applied for. It is also 
clear to the effect that it is not the number of days of delay 
that matters, but the attitude of the party which caused the 
delay. In other words when the Court finds that the party 
who failed to approach the Court within the time stipulated 
comes forward with an explanation for condoning the 
delay, the Court if satisfied that the delay occasioned not 
due to the deliberate conduct of the party, but due to any 
other reason, then by sufficiently compensating the 
prejudice caused to the other side monetarily, the 
condonation of delay can be favorably ordered.
23/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
The Division Bench in the above said case made an 
observation that a liberal approach should be extended 
while considering the application for condonation of delay. 
Sufficient caution has been exhibited to note that wherever 
there is a lack of bonafides or attempt to hoodwink the 
Court by the party concerned who has come forward with 
an application for condonation of delay, in such cases, no 
indulgence should be shown by condoning the delay 
applied for. It is observed that question of limitation is not 
merely a technical consideration but based on principles of 
sound public policy as well as equity and that a litigant 
cannot be expected to have Damocles' sword hanging over 
his had indefinitely for a period to be determined at the 
whims and fancies of the opponent.
12. Thus, the Courts have taken a clear view that the 
intention of the parties in filing appeal belatedly after 
causing prejudice to the interest of the other parties, then 
also the delay cannot be condoned by exercising the power 
24/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
of discretion. Therefore all these aspects are to be 
considered. Mechanical or routine approach is 
impermissible, may be permissible in respect of the delay 
of short span and not otherwise. 
13. In the case of Lanka Venkateswarlu (D) by L.R.s 
Vs. State of A.P. & others reported in 
MANU/SC/0153/2011, the Hon’ble Supreme Court made 
an observation as follows;
“20. In the case of M. Balakrishnan (supra), this 
Court again reiterated the principle that rules of limitation 
are not meant to destroy the rights of parties. They are 
meant to see that the parties do not resort to dilatory 
tactics, but seek their remedy promptly.
21 to 25.........
26.We are at a loss to fathom any logic or rationale, 
which could have impelled the High Court to condone the 
delay after holding the same to be unjustifiable. The 
concepts such as "liberal approach", "justice oriented 
approach", "substantial justice" can not be employed to 
jettison the substantial law of limitation. Especially, in 
cases where the Court concludes that there is no 
justification for the delay. In our opinion, the approach 
25/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
adopted by the High Court tends to show the absence of 
judicial balance and restraint, which a Judge is required to 
maintain whilst adjudicating any lis between the parties. 
We are rather pained to notice that in this case, not being 
satisfied with the use of mere intemperate language, the 
High Court resorted to blatant sarcasms.
The use of unduly strong intemperate or extravagant 
language in a judgment has been repeatedly disapproved 
by this Court in a number of cases. Whilst considering 
applications for condonation of delay under Section 5 of the 
Limitation Act, the Courts do not enjoy unlimited and 
unbridled discretionary powers. All discretionary powers, 
especially judicial powers, have to be exercised within 
reasonable bounds, known to the law. The discretion has to 
be exercised in a systematic manner informed by reason. 
Whims or fancies; prejudices or predilections can not and 
should not form the basis of exercising discretionary 
powers."
14. In the case of Pundlik Jalam Patil (D) by Lrs. Vs. 
Exe.Eng.Jalgaon Medium Project & others reported in 
MANU/SC/4694/2004, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held 
as follows:
“15. In Ajit Singh Thakur Singh and anr. vs. State of 
26/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
Gujarat [ (1981) 1 SCC 495 ] this court observed :
"It is true that a party is entitled to wait until the last day 
of limitation for filing an appeal. But when it allows 
limitation to expire and pleads sufficient cause for not filing 
the appeal earlier, the sufficient cause must establish that 
because of some event or circumstance arising before 
limitation expired it was not possible to file the appeal 
within time. No event or circumstance arising after the 
expiry of limitation can constitute sufficient cause."
(Emphasis supplied) This judgment squarely applies to the 
facts in hand.
17. Shri Mohta, learned senior counsel relying on the 
decision of this court in N. Balakrishnan vs. 
M.Krishnamurthy [(1998) 7 SCC 123] submitted that 
length of delay is no matter, acceptability of explanation is 
the only criterion. It was submitted that if the explanation 
offered does not smack of mala fides or it is not put forth 
as part of dilatory tactics the court must show utmost 
consideration to the suitor. The very said decision upon 
which reliance has been placed holds that the law of 
limitation fixes a life span for every legal remedy for the 
redress of the legal injury suffered. Unending period for 
launching the remedy may lead to unending uncertainty 
and consequential anarchy. The law of Limitation is thus 
founded on public policy. The decision does not lay down 
that a lethargic litigant can leisurely choose his own time in 
27/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
preferring appeal or application as the case may be. On the 
other hand, in the said judgment it is said that court should 
not forget the opposite party altogether. It is observed:
"It is enshrined in the maxim interest reipublicae up sit finis 
litium ( it is for the general welfare that a period be put to 
litigation). Rules of limitation are not meant to destroy the 
rights of the parties. They are meant to see that parties do 
not resort to dilatory tactics but seek their remedy 
promptly. The idea is that every legal remedy must be kept 
alive for a legislatively fixed period of time."
18. In Ramlal and others vs. Rewa Coalfields Ltd. 
[ AIR 1962 SC 361], this court held that: "in construing 
Section 5 of the Limitation Act, it is relevant to bear in 
mind two important considerations. The first consideration 
is that the expiration of period of limitation prescribed for 
making an appeal gives rise to right in favour of the decree 
holder to treat the decree as binding between the parties 
and this legal right which has accrued to the decree holder 
by lapse of time should not be light heartedly disturbed. 
The other consideration which cannot be ignored is that if 
sufficient cause of excusing delay is shown discretion is 
given to the court to condone the delay and admit the 
appeal. `It is further necessa ry to emphasis that even if 
the sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled 
to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of 
28/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a condition 
precedent for the exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction 
vested in the court by section 5. This aspect of the matter 
naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts 
and it is at this stage the diligence of the party of its bona 
fides may fall for consideration." On the facts and in the 
circumstances, we are of the opinion that the respondent 
beneficiary was not diligent in availing the remedy of 
appeal. The averments made in the application seeking 
condonation of delay in filing appeals do not show any 
acceptable cause much less sufficient cause to exercise 
courts' discretion in its favour."
15. In the case of Esha Bhattacharjee Vs. Managing 
Commit tee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy & Others 
reported in  MANU/SC/0932/2013, the Hon’ble Apex 
Court of India made an observation as follows: 
“15. From the aforesaid authorities the principles that can 
broadly be culled out are:
i) There should be a liberal, pragmatic, justice-oriented, 
non- pedantic approach while dealing with an application 
for condonation of delay, for the courts are not supposed to 
legalise injustice but are obliged to remove injustice.
ii) The terms sufficient cause should be understood in their 
29/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
proper spirit, philosophy and purpose regard being had to 
the fact that these terms are basically elastic and are to be 
applied in proper perspective to the obtaining fact- 
situation.
iii) Substantial justice being paramount and pivotal the 
technical considerations should not be given undue and 
uncalled for emphasis.
iv) No presumption can be attached to deliberate causation 
of delay but, gross negligence on the part of the counsel or 
litigant is to be taken note of.
v) Lack of bona fides imputable to a party seeking 
condonation of delay is a significant and relevant
fact.
vi) It is to be kept in mind that adherence to strict proof 
should not affect public justice and cause public mischief 
because the courts are required to be vigilant so that in the 
ultimate eventuate there is no real failure of justice.
vii) The concept of liberal approach has to encapsule the 
conception of reasonableness and it cannot be allowed a 
totally unfettered free play. 
viii) There is a distinction between inordinate delay and a 
delay of short duration or few days, for to the former 
doctrine of prejudice is attracted whereas to the latter it 
may not be attracted. That apart, the first one warrants 
strict approach whereas the second calls for a liberal 
delineation.
30/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
ix) The conduct, behaviour and attitude of a party relating 
to its inaction or negligence are relevant factors to be 
taken into consideration. It is so as the  fundamental 
principle is that the courts are required to weigh the scale 
of balance of justice in respect of both parties and the said 
principle cannot be given a total go by in the name of 
liberal approach.
x) If the explanation offered is concocted or the grounds 
urged in the application are fanciful, the courts should be 
vigilant not to expose the other side unnecessa rily to face 
such a litigation.
xi) It is to be borne in mind that no one gets away with 
fraud, misrepresentation or interpolation by taking 
recourse to the technicalities of law of limitation.
xii) The entire gamut of facts are to be carefully scrutinized 
and the approach should be based on the paradigm of 
judicial discretion which is founded on objective reasoning 
and not on individual perception.
xiii) The State or a public body or an entity representing a 
collective cause should be given some
acceptable latitude.
16. To the aforesaid principles we may add some 
more guidelines taking note of the present day
scenario. They are: -
a) An application for condonation of delay should be 
drafted with careful concern and not in a half hazard 
31/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
manner harbouring the notion that the courts are required 
to condone delay on the bedrock of the principle that 
adjudication of a lis on merits is seminal to justice 
dispensation system.
b) An application for condonation of delay should not be 
dealt with in a routine manner on the base
of individual philosophy which is basically subjective.
c) Though no precise formula can be laid down regard 
being had to the concept of judicial discretion, yet a 
conscious effort for achieving consistency and collegiality of 
the adjudicatory system should be made as that is the 
ultimate institutional motto.
d) The increasing tendency to perceive delay as a non- 
serious matter and, hence, lackadaisical propensity can be 
exhibited in a non-challant manner requires to be curbed, 
of course, within legal parameters."
It is very important to consider the judgement of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Esha 
Bhattacharjee, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court laid down 
certain principles which were culled out  particularly and 
those principles are the guiding principles for the purpose 
of deciding the petitions filed to condone the delay. The 
above principles, cited supra reveals that the concept of 
32/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
liberal approach has to encapsule the conception of 
reasonableness and it cannot be allowed totally to 
unfettered free play.
16. The concepts such as “liberal approach”, “justice 
oriented approach”, “substantial justice” cannot be 
employed in jettison the substantial law of limitation. The 
law of limitation is substantial and therefore the principles 
laid down is to be scrupulously followed while condoning 
the delay under the law of limitation. The limitation has got 
a specific purpose and object and more specifically to avoid 
prejudice to the respective parties. In the event of 
prolongation or protraction of the litigation, undoubtedly 
and for an unspecified period when the specific law of 
limitation has got a specific purpose and object, then the 
power of discretion is to be exercised cautiously. Power of 
discretion cannot be exercised in the absence of any valid 
reason. In other words, powers can be exercised for the 
purpose of passing orders only by recording reasons which 
must be candid and convincing and must be passed on 
33/36
http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 in
AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019
certain sound legal principles. Therefore, recording of 
reasons for exercising discretionary powers is one of the 
elementary principles of law. In the event of exercising 
discretionary powers without recording reasons, 
undoubtedly the same would cause not only prejudice and 
will set a bad principle and therefore, the Courts must be 
cautious while exercising power of discretion more 
specifically in such matters where the law of Limitation is 
substantial.”
7. In view of the legal principles and the facts and 
circumstances in the present case on hand, this Court is of an 
opinion that the petitioner has not made out any acceptable ground 
for the purpose of condoning the delay and consequently, the 
miscellaneous petition in C.M.P.No.21826 of 2019 stands dismissed. 
Accordingly, AS.SR.No.118176 of 2019 is rejected at the SR Stage 
itself. No costs.
