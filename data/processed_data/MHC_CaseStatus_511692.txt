W.P.No.20999 of 2003
Writ petition filed under Article 226 of Constitution of India 
praying for issuance of a Writ of Certiorari calling for the records in 
No.PA/GI No.AADPH7768C, dated 30th June 2003 and quash the 
same. 
        For Petitioner         : Mr.M.P.Senthil Kumar
        For Respondents    : Mr.A.P.Srinivas 
 
ORDER
This writ petition has been filed seeking for a writ of certiorari to 
call for the records in No.PA/GI No.AADPH7768C, dated 30.06.2003 
and quash the same.
2. The necessa ry facts which are required to be noticed for the 
disposal of this writ petition are as follows :
(i) The petitioner (Dr.Bharat Mehta), who died during the 
pendency of the writ petition, in whose place his legal representative, 
one Mehul Mehta has been substituted as P2, hence the term 
petitioner denotes only the original petitioner, i.e., P1-Dr.Bharat Mehta 
(for the sake of convenience),who was a medical practitioner and also 
he was doing some business along with some of his family members. 
The petitioner was the income tax assessee  from 1978-79 onwards. He 
was residing at No.4/181, Kodambakkam High Road, Chennai - 34 and 
2/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
he was having a clinic at No.87, N.S.C.Bose Road, Chennai along with 
his father Dr.M.J.Mehta.
(ii) The said residential premises, i.e., No.4/181, Kodambakkam 
High Road, Chennai - 34 seem s to be the joint family property, where 
some family business also is being undertaken by the family members 
including the petitioner and his brother one Hemant Mehta. 
(iii) While so, in the year 2001, i.e., in January 2001, on 
25.01.2001, the premises of the petitioner was searched for the block 
period from 01.04.1990 to 31.03.2000 and 01.04.2000 to 24.01.2001 
under the warrant / authorisation issued in this regard, by the team of 
respondents / Revenue and on 25.01.2001, a panchanama were 
recorded, where according to the petitioner, the search was concluded 
on 25.01.2001, however, on that day, under Section 132(3) of the 
Income Tax Act 1961 (herein after referred to as "the Act"), a 
prohibitory order was issued by the Revenue. 
(iv) Simultaneously the other premises, i.e., at No.23, Noor 
Veeraswamy Street, Chennai - 34 also was searched on the same day, 
i.e., on 25.01.2001. Thereafter pursuant to the prohibitory order 
3/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
issued by the Revenue, subsequent searches were taken place on 
various dates during January, February, March, April, May and June 
2001 and last such search operations was completed on 12.06.2001 
and on that date also, a panchanama was drawn.
(v) Subsequent to the said search operations and seizure made 
under Section 132 of the Act, a notice under Section 158BC of the Act 
was issued on 05.10.2001 by the Revenue and pursuant to which, the 
petitioner filed a return for the block period from 01.04.1990 to 
24.01.2001 on 23.10.2001. Thereafter there had been number of 
correspondences between the petitioner and the Revenue and 
ultimately the Block Assess ment Order for the said block period from 
01.04.1990 to 31.03.2000 and from 01.04.2000 to 24.01.2001 was 
issued by the Revenue on 30.06.2003, computing the tax, surcharge 
and interest payable on the undisclosed income by the petitioner to the 
extent of Rs.5,23,08,245/-. In the said block assessm ent order, the 
Revenue also initiated penalty proceedings as per proviso to Section 
158BFA (2) of the Act. 
(vi) Though an appeal remedy is available to the petitioner to 
assail the said Block Assessm ent Order, the petitioner has chosen to 
4/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
file this writ petition on the ground that, the very Block Assessm ent 
Order itself is barred by limitation under the provision, i.e., 
158BE(1)(b) and also on the ground that there was no notice under 
Section 143(2) of the Act issued and even if it was issued, that was 
also barred by limitation and there had been no prior approval of the 
Joint Commissioner of Income Tax which ought to have been obtained 
under Section 158BG of the Act and there had been a violation of 
principles of natural justice. Therefore on these grounds, instead of 
filing a regular appeal, the petitioner filed the present writ petition, 
challenging the Block Assessm ent Order, which is impugned herein, 
dated 30.06.2003 issued by the Revenue, to quash the same as 
prayed therein. That is how this writ petition has come up before this 
Court.
(vii) During the pendency of the writ petition, the original writ 
petitioner, Dr.Bharat Mehta deceased and in whose place the legal 
representative of the deceased, Dr.Bharat Mehta, one Mr.Mehul Mehta 
has been substituted by the orders of this Court, dated 12.09.2017 
and who contested this case.

W.P.No.20999 of 2003
3. Mr.M.P.Senthil Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the 
petitioner has raised the following grounds in order to assail the 
impugned Block Assessm ent Order :
(a) The Block Assessm ent Order under 
Section 158BC r/w Section 158BD is barred by 
limitation as per Section 158BE (1)(b).
(b) The notice under Section 143(2) 
which is mandatorily to be issued even in 
respect of 158BC proceedings, had not been 
issued and assuming if it is issued belatedly, 
that is also barred by limitation.
(c) Under Section 158BG, prior approval 
was to be obtained to proceed, from JCIT, 
which was not obtained and the learned 
counsel also raised the ground that, there has 
been no opportunity given to the petitioner 
during the entire proceedings, which ended in 
the impugned Block Assessm ent Order, thereby 
the Revenue violated the principles of natural 
justice.
4. By raising the aforesaid grounds, the learned counsel tried to 
assail the impugned Block Assessm ent Order. In support of his 
6/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that, 
totally two premises of the petitioner was searched and documents 
were seized and according to the Revenue, the said search was 
conducted in both the premises on 25.01.2001 pursuant to the 
authorisation given on 25.01.2001 itself and the search was over on 
that day and in the panchanama issued on that day by the Revenue, 
they have clearly mentioned that, the search was concluded. 
5. When that being the position, thereafter, the question of 
issuing prohibitory order under Section 132(3) of the Act does not 
arise, however, prohibitory order was issued and on the strength of 
the prohibitory order, after a long gap, sever al times search and 
seizure operations taken place at the premises of the petitioner and 
according to the Revenue, it was a continuous search and which was 
over only on 12.06.2001, therefore the said date, namely 12.06.2001 
shall be reckoned as the date for commencing the limitation period, 
within the meaning of Section 158BE (1)(b) of the Act, thereby the 
impugned order, i.e., Block Assessm ent Order, dated 30.06.2003 is 
within the limitation period of two years, thereby the impugned order 
is not hit by the limitation under Section 158BE (1) (b). 
7/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
6. However the learned counsel for the petitioner would contend 
that, once the search was over on 25.01.2001 itself pursuant to the 
authorisation given in this regard and there has been no further 
authorisation given by the Revenue to continue the search, the very 
issuance of prohibitory order under Section 132(3) itself was 
unwarranted and therefore on that strength, there could be no further 
search on the very same authorisation. Therefore for the purpose of 
computing the limitation under Section 158BE(1)(b), the authorisation 
dated 25.01.2001 and the panchanama dated 25.01.2001 shall alone 
be treated as starting point of the limitation and if that is taken into 
account, the two years period from the end of the month in which the 
last  of the authorisation of search under Section 132 was issued would 
be over by 31.01.2003 and therefore the impugned Block Assessm ent 
Order dated 30.06.2003 is certainly beyond the two years limitation 
period, thereby it is barred by limitation under Section 158BE(1)(b).
 
7. The learned counsel would further submit that, in respect of 
Block Assess ment under Section 158BC, the Assessi ng Officer shall 
proceed to determine the undisclosed income of the block period in the 
manner laid down in Section 158BB and the provisions of Sections 142 
and 143(2) and (3) so far as may be applied, which means that, 
8/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
whenever Section 158BC proceedings is initiated to proceed to 
determine the undisclosed income of block period, the provisions which 
includes Section 143 of the Act would apply, therefore, a notice under 
Section 143(2) should have been issued, which has either not been 
issued or if it is issued, which is beyond the limitation.
8. The learned counsel would further submit that, under Section 
158BG, the order of Assess ment for the block period shall be passed 
by an Assessing Officer not below the rank of Assistant Commissioner 
or Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Director or Deputy Director as 
the case may be, however such order shall not be passed without the 
previous approval of the Principal Commissioner or Principal Director or 
Director in case of search initiated under Section 132.
9. Here in the case in hand, since it is after 1st January 1997, 
Section 158BG proviso (b) shall apply, under which, the Joint 
Commissioner or the Joint Director, as the case may be has to give 
approval.
10. The learned counsel in this context would submit that, no 
such approval seem s to have been obtained by the Revenue and such 
approval order has not been served or produced to the petitioner.
9/60

W.P.No.20999 of 2003
11. The learned counsel for the petitioner would further submit 
that, throughout the assessm ent proceedings, no proper opportunity, 
as has been contemplated under various provisions of the Income Tax 
Act, have been given to the petitioner and therefore, the very principle 
of natural justice has been glaringly violated by the Revenue and 
therefore on that ground itself, the impugned Block Assess ment Order 
has to be interfered with, he contended.
12. In support of these contentions, the learned counsel for the 
petitioner has relied upon various judgments, among them, he heavily 
relied upon the following judgments : 
1. A.Rakesh Kumar Jain v. Joint Commissioner of Income tax, 
(2012) 254 CTC 0576 : (2012) 80 DTR 0257
2. C.Ramaiah Reddy v. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, 
(2011) 339 ITR 210 (Karnataka) : (2011) 244 CTR 126 (Karnataka)
13. Per contra, Mr.A.P.Srinivas, learned standing counsel 
appearing for the Revenue, by relying upon the averments made in the 
counter affidavit filed by the Revenue would contend that, the 
petitioner was subjected to a search under Section 132 of the Act on 
25.01.2001. The search was carried out in the places of the petitioner 
10/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
and his family members, who run a family business, namely a 
company called M/s. Emcorp Finance Ltd., on the basis of separate 
warrants of authorisation issued in each case by the Director of 
Income Tax (Investigation), Chennai. At the time of commencement of 
the search operation, the warrant of authorisation in the name of the 
petitioner was produced to him and he has affixed his signature 
thereon for having seen the same.
14. He would further submit that, in so far as the conclusion of 
the search on 25.01.2001 and therefore there was no necessi ty to 
issue a prohibitory order is concerned, in so far as the premises at 
No.4/181, Kodambakkam High Road, Chennai - 34 is concerned, the 
search was inconclusive and it was not concluded, therefore 
prohibitory order was issued. He would further submit that, the search 
was initiated on 25.01.2001 at No.4/181, Kodambakkam High Road 
and it continued on 30.01.2001, 02.02.2001, 08.02.2001, 20.02.2001, 
23.02.2001, 14.03.2001, 04.04.2001, 22.05.2001 and finally on 
12.06.2001. Only on 12.06.2001, the search was finally concluded and 
on that date also, panchanama had been drawn and each and every 
time when the search was conducted on the aforesaid dates, separate 
panchanama were drawn and prohibitory orders were issued. 
11/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
15. In so far as the long continuation of search starting from 
25.01.2001 and ends up on 12.06.2001, the learned standing counsel 
for Revenue would contend that, during the search, certain electronic 
devices were found, where lot of documents were uploaded or saved 
by the assessee  / petitioner and when the same was questioned, the 
petitioner, till the last search, was not co-operating with the Revenue 
to disclose the password to have access  with those documents, 
therefore for these kind of purposes, the search operation was 
continued in the premises at No.4/181, Kodambakkam High Road, 
Chennai - 34 and it  ended only on 12.06.2001, where the Revenue 
was able to access  with the software documents stored in the 
computer and thereafter only the search operation was completed and 
the Revenue proceeded to further.
16. The learned standing counsel would also submit that, the 
search at No.23, Noor Veeraswamy Street, Chennai - 34 was 
commenced at 1 p.m, on 25.01.2001 and concluded at 1.45 p.m, on 
the same date and therefore in so far as the said search is concerned 
at that premises, it was concluded on the same day itself. However in 
so far as the search at No.4/181, Kodambakkam High Road, Chennai - 
600 034 is concerned, it commenced at about 1 p.m, on 25.01.2001 
12/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
and concluded on 09.50 p.m on 25.01.2001, that means, the search 
was inconclusive on 25.01.2001 and therefore based on the 
panchanama, prohibitory orders were issued in respect of that 
premises. 
17. He would further submit that, ultimately on 05.10.2001, 
notice under Section 158BC was issued to the petitioner to file the 
return of his undisclosed income for the block period in Form 2B and 
pursuant to which, the petitioner also filed the requisite return in Form 
2B on 23.10.2001.
18. The learned standing counsel on the point of notice under 
Section 143(2) of the Act, has submitted that, the said notice under 
Section 143(2) of the Act was issued on 06.06.2003 and served by 
way of affixture on 10.06.2003. The attempt to serve the notice to the 
assessee  / petitioner was unsuccessf ul on the first three successi ve 
occasions, as there was nobody willing to receive the same, therefore 
the Revenue had no option excep t to serve it by way of affixture. In 
this context, the detailed averment made by the Revenue in the 
counter affidavit has been relied upon by the learned standing counsel.
13/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
19. The learned standing counsel would therefore submit that, 
the limitation for the purpose of Section 158BE(1)(b) would not 
commence from 01.02.2001 and it would commence only from 
01.07.2001, since the last search was conducted only on 12.06.2001 
and the month of last such search ends only on 30.06.2001, therefore 
the impugned Assessm ent Order which was issued on 30.06.2003 is 
saved within the limitation period of 158BE(1)(b).
20. The learned standing counsel would also submit that, prior 
approval of the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax was obtained under 
Section 158BG and throughout the proceedings till the end of the 
Assess ment Order, sever al times notices were issued and sever al 
correspondences had been made by the petitioner and the procedure 
contemplated under various provisions of the Act had been 
scrupulously followed by giving opportunity as has been contemplated 
under the provisions of the Act to the petitioner. Therefore the 
allegation made against the Revenue by the petitioner that, there has 
been violation of principles of natural justice is only an allegation for 
the sake of making it to approach this Court by filing writ petition 
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, since the petitioner is 
very well aware that, there is a statutory alternative efficacious 
14/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
appellate remedy, which admittedly the petitioner has not availed and 
has approached straight away this Court by invoking the extraordinary 
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and only 
for the sake of approaching this Court by invoking the writ jurisdiction, 
the said allegation of violation of principles of natural justice has been 
made.
21. On the side of the citations referred to by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner, the learned standing counsel for the 
Revenue would submit that, the two Judgments, namely Rakesh 
Kumar Jain as well as Ramaiah Reddy cases (cited supra) cannot be 
made applicable to the facts of the present case, instead, a Division 
Bench of this Court order made in Deputy Commissioner of Income-
Tax, Central Circle II(1) v. Rakesh Sarin, reported in (2014) 222 
Taxman 84 (Madras) : (2014) 362 ITR 619 (Madras) would apply to 
the facts of the present case, where the earlier two decisions, namely 
Rakesh Kumar Jain and Ramaiah Reddy cases (cited supra) had been 
considered. Therefore on the strength of the aforesaid two decisions, 
the petitioner /assessee  cannot make out a case to state that, the 
limitation under Section 158BE(1)(b) would commence from the end of 
the month of the last panchanama, which according to the petitioner 
15/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
was 25.01.2001 and not from June 2001, as the Revenue claimed the 
last panchanama was 12.06.2001 and therefore the said decisions 
cited by the petitioner side, according to the learned standing counsel 
for the Revenue, would no way enhance the winability of the 
petitioner's case. Therefore the learned standing counsel would submit 
that, the impugned Block Assessm ent Order is sustainable and the 
very invocation of the provisions of Article 226 by the petitioner 
without taking the route of the appellate remedy would itself fatal to 
the case of the petitioner and therefore the writ petition is liable to be 
dismissed, he contended.
22. I have given my anxious consideration to the rival 
submissions made by the learned respective counsel appearing for the 
petitioner as well as the Revenue and have perused the materials 
placed before this Court.
23. The Revenue though raised an objection that, the writ 
petition cannot be entertained as it is not maintainable in view of the 
appellate remedy available under the Act to the petitioner, however, 
since the writ petition is of the year 2003, where the point of alleged 
violation of principles of natural justice as well as the limitation point 
16/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
under Section 158BE(1)(b) and also the alleged non-issuance of notice 
under Section 143(2) of the Act since had been raised, probably on 
these grounds, the writ petition would have been admitted already and 
therefore at this length of time, during the final hearing, this Court is 
not impressed  with the  said ground raised by the Revenue side to 
dismiss the writ petition on the ground of availability of appellate 
remedy. Therefore this Court feel that, the writ petition can be 
entertained in view of the grounds raised by the petitioner.
24. The ground that, there has been no approval from the Joint 
Commissioner of Income Tax as contemplated under Section 158BG is 
concerned, it has been specifically averred in the counter affidavit filed 
by the respondent that, as per the Notification, dated 16.04.2003, the 
Commissioner of Income-Tax, Central-I, Chennai, had transferred the 
case to the DCIT, Central Circle I(5), Chennai to DCIT, Central Circle 
I(3) Chennai, w.e.f., 16.04.2003. Though no specific averment has 
been made that, the initial approval was given by JCIT under Section 
158BG, it is the vehement contention on the part of the Revenue that, 
only pursuant to the approval given by the JCIT, the search in the 
premises of the assessee  / petitioner was made, of course on specific 
authorisation. Taking into account of these factors, since it is an 
17/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
allegation and the denial and the Revenue has maintained that Section 
158BG has been complied with, this Court accept the same. 
25. In so far as the allegation that, there was no notice under 
Section 143(2) served on the petitioner is concerned, the specific 
averment made in the counter affidavit reads thus : 
"33. The notice u/s 158BC was issued in this 
case on 05.10.2001 requiring the petitioner to 
file a return of his undisclosed income for the 
block period in Form 2B. In this connection, the 
allegation that the block period was not 
specified in the said notice is not correct in so 
far as in the notice itself it is made known that 
the "block period" is as mentioned in section 
158B(a) of the Income Tax Act. Further, the 
petitioner filed the requisite return in Form 2B 
on 23.10.2001. I state that the notice u/s 
143(2) of the Income Tax Act was issued on 
6.6.2003 and served (by affixture) on 
10.6.2003. 
34. The allegation that no valid notice u/s 
143(2) was issued to the petitioner is factually 
incorrect. The notice was issued on 6.6.2003. 
The attempts to serve the notice was not 
successf ul on the first three success ive 
18/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
occasions since there was nobody willing to 
receive the same. Accordingly, it had to be 
served by affixture on the fourth occasion. The 
allegation regarding harassment of any sort 
with ulterior motive is totally baseless and it is 
only a fiction to justify the filing of writ petition.
35. I submit that the allegation that a notice 
u/s 143(2) was not issued and that a notice u/s 
142(1) only was issued is not correct since the 
notices u/s 143(2) and 142(1) were issued on 
the same date (6.6.2003) and also served on 
the same date (10.6.2003). In the above 
assess ment order, the Assessing Officer was 
mentioning the reason why the notice u/s 
142(1) was issued "only on 6.6.2003" whereas 
the petitioner attempts to read the word "only" 
in connection with the words "notice u/s 
142(1)" to present as if only the notice u/s 
142(1) was issued. This is not correct and the 
petitioner is well aware of the same. The 
allegation that no notice u/s 143(2) was issued 
and that the petitioner represented his case 
before the first respondent only on the basis of 
oral requirement is factually incorrect.
36. The allegation that adequate opportunity 
was not given to the petitioner before the 
completion of the block assess ment is factually 
19/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
incorrect since the case was discussed with the 
petitioner and his representatives on as much 
as six occasions. Further Further, written 
submissions filed by the petitioner were also 
duly considered."
26. In view of the said factual matrix as has been averred in the 
counter affidavit, which is not denied by the petitioner / assessee,  the 
said ground raised by the petitioner that, no notice under Section 
143(2) was issued, cannot be accepted.
27. Now the main issue, as raised by the petitioner side, as to 
whether the Block Assess ment Proceedings, i.e., the Assessm ent Order 
under Section 158BC r/w 158BD is barred by limitation under Section 
158BE (1) (b) or not, can be gone into.
28. In this context, the contention of the petitioner side is that, 
on 25.01.2001, first search was made in both the premises and on 
that date, a panchanama was drawn, where it has been specifically 
mentioned that, "search concluded", however on the very same date, 
the prohibitory order under Section 132(3) of the Act was issued by 
the Revenue which is unwarranted. Therefore on the strength of the 
20/60

W.P.No.20999 of 2003
said prohibitory order continuous search was made on various dates till 
June 2001 and therefore by taking advantage of those subsequent 
searches, which are unauthorised, the Revenue cannot claim that, the 
last panchanama was drawn only on 12.06.2001 and therefore the 
limitation for the purpose of Section 158BE(1)(b) would commence 
only after the end of the month where the last such panchanama was 
drawn, i.e., 30.06.2001 and therefore the impugned order, since was 
passed on 30.06.2003, is within the limitation, cannot be accepted, is 
concerned, as has been pointed out by the learned standing counsel 
for the Revenue, the search was conducted on 25.01.2001 in two 
premises, one is at 23, Noor Veeraswamy Street, Chennai - 34 and 
another one is at No.4/181, Kodambakkam High Road, Chennai - 34.
29.  I have perused the copy of the panchanamas issued in 
respect of both premises, dated 25.01.2001 and a copy of which also 
had been filed by the petitioner in the typedset of papers which 
discloses that, in so far as the panchanama in respect of No.23, Noor 
Veeraswamy Street, Chennai - 34 is concerned, it has been specifically 
written in the panchanama by the Revenue that "search concluded".
21/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
30. However in respect of panchanama issued on the same date, 
i.e., on 25.01.2001 in respect of the premises at No.4/181, 
Kodambakkam High Road, Chennai - 34, the panchanama specifically 
mentions that "search continues" and on that date, prohibitory order 
was issued only in respect of No.4/181, Kodambakkam High Road, 
Chennai - 34 premises and not in respect of No.23, Noor Veeraswamy 
Street, Chennai - 34.
31. Even on subsequent dates also, i.e., in the months of 
February to June, each time when the panchanamas were drawn as a 
proof for having searched the premises at No.4/181, Kodambakkam 
High Road, Chennai - 34 is concerned, according to the Revenue, the 
search continued, therefore every time, prohibitory order under 
Section 132(3) of Income Tax Act was issued and lastly the search was 
completed on 12.06.2001. Therefore the panchanama drawn on 
12.06.2001 is the culmination of continuation of panchanamas in 
respect of the same premises, i.e., No.4/181, Kodambakkam High 
Road, Chennai-34 and therefore that should alone be treated as a last 
panchanama drawn by the Revenue in respect of the said premises.
32. With these factual matrix, the relevant provisions of the Act 
can be looked into.
22/60

W.P.No.20999 of 2003
33. Section 158BE, which contemplate the limitation, reads thus: 
"Time limit for completion of block assessm ent 
158BE (1) The order under section 158BC shall 
be passed - 
(a) within one year from the end of the month 
in which the last of the authorisation for search 
under section 132 or for requisition under 
section 132A, as the case may be, was 
execu ted in cases where a search is initiated or 
books of account or other documents or any 
assets are requisitioned after the 30th day of 
June, 1995, but before the 1st day of January, 
1997.
(b) within two years from the end of the month 
in which the last of the authorisations for search 
under section 132 or for requisition under 
section 132A, as the case may be, was 
execu ted in cases where a search is initiated or 
books of account or other documents or any 
assets are requisitioned on or after the 1st day 
of January, 1997."
34. Explanation (2) to Section 158BE is very relevant, that is 
also extracted hereunder for easy reference : 
"Explanation 2 - For the removal of doubts, it 
is hereby declared that the authorisation 
23/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
referred to in sub-section (1) shall be deemed 
to have been execu ted -
(a) in the case of search, on the conclusion of 
search as recorded in the last panchanama 
drawn in relation to any person in whose case 
the warrant of authorisation has been issued;
(b) in the case of requisition under section 
132A, on the actual receipt of the books of 
account or other documents or assets by the 
Authorised Officer."
35. For any assessm ent under Section 158BC, there must be a 
search under Section 132 and if a search is conducted under Section 
132, on the conclusion of such search, as recorded in the last 
panchanama drawn, it shall be deemed to have been execu ted as 
authorisation for the purpose of limitation as contemplated under 
Section 158BE(1) (a) & (b) and in this case, 158BE(1)(b) would apply 
since it is a case after 1st January 1997.
36. This provision of Section 158BE with the explanation (2) has 
been widely discussed and interpreted by the Karnataka High Court in 
C.Ramaiah Reddy v. Assistant Commis sioner of Income Tax, 
reported in (2011) 339 ITR 210 (Karnataka) : (2011) 244 CTR 
24/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
126 (Karnataka). In order to appreciate the same, the relevant 
portion of Ramaiah Reddy's case of Karnataka High Court is extracted 
hereunder : 
"77. The panchnama referred to in Explanation 
2 to the said section specifically refers to search 
under section 132 and section 132 specifically 
refers to authorisation to enter and search and 
it has no reference to entering and searching 
the premises which are the subject-matter of 
prohibitory order or restraint order. No 
authorisation is required to enter the premises 
and inspect the materials which are the subject-
matter of prohibitory order or restraint order. 
The said order itself acts as an authorisation to 
enter the premises and inspect the materials 
which are the subject-matter of those orders 
and it also empower them to seize any 
incriminating material. However, after entering 
the premises of such person, he has to confine 
his actions only for inspection of the subject-
matter of prohibitory order or restraint order. 
He cannot search the premises over again. Any 
material seized after such inspection would be 
the undisclosed income for the purpose of the 
block assess ment in pursuance of search under 
section 132(1) of the Act. The panchnama 
25/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
evidencing such inspection and seizure would 
be the last panchnama in respect of the said 
premises. But for the purpose of limitation 
under section 158BE, it would not be the last 
panchnama drawn in proof of conclusion of 
search, as defined in Explanation 2 to section 
158BE. For the purpose of limitation, there can 
be only one search and one panchnama.
78. The law expressly provides for more than 
one authorisation. A search authorisation could 
specify only one building / place / vessel  / 
vehicle/aircraft. This is clear from the use of the 
building, etc., in the singular sense. Section 
132(1) uses building / place / vessel / vehicle / 
aircraft in singular sense. Further, clause (a) in 
Form 45 uses the word, “to enter and search, 
the said building / place /vessel  / vehicle / 
aircraft. When there are multiple places to 
search and such places are far off, it is 
impractical to have a single authorisation. 
Different persons will be carrying out search 
and each one of them is required to be 
authorised through the search authorisation. In 
other words, search authorisation should 
authorise a particular official for execu ting the 
search. Therefore, when there are different 
places to be searched, separate search 
26/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
authorisation should be drawn with reference to 
each place of search. The said authorisations 
may be issued on different dates in which case, 
the last of such authorisations is to be looked 
into for the purpose of limitation. However, it is 
possible that there may be more than one 
authorisation on the same day. Then the 
question is which is the last of such 
authorisations for the purpose of limitation. 
When all the authorisations are execu ted there 
will be one panchnama in respect of each such 
authorisation. The authorisations may be 
execu ted on different dates also. Then the 
doubt would arise regarding which authorisation 
to be looked into for the purpose of limitation 
as all of them are last authorisation. It is for 
removal of that doubts that the Explanation is 
inserted. For the purpose of computing the 
limitation, it is the one year from the end of the 
month in which the last of the authorisations 
was execu ted. If there are more than one 
authorisation issued on the same day, then the 
last panchnama drawn in relation to the 
warrant of authorisation issued on the same 
day. As the period commences from the end of 
the month of the execu tion of the authorisation, 
the law has provided for the authorised officer 
27/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
to visit the premises for the purpose of 
inspection regarding the material which is the 
subject-matter of prohibitory order or the 
restraint order, even after search. However, the 
said exercise has to be done expeditiously, as 
the period of limitation starts from the date of 
search was concluded as evidenced by the 
panchnama, as otherwise the very object with 
which these provisions was introduced would be 
defeated.
79. Circular No. 772, dated 23rd December, 
1998, issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes 
explains this position as under ([1999] 235 ITR 
(St.) 35):
“According to section 158BE, limitation of 2 
years has to be counted from the end of the 
month in which last of the authorisations was 
execu ted. Use of the word ‘authorisations’ 
implies issue of more than one authorisation. 
Supposingly two authorisations are issued one 
after the other and the last authorisation is 
execu ted first while the authorisation issued 
earlier is execu ted later on. In such case, 
limitation should be counted from the date of 
issue of the execu tion of the last authorisation, 
though it is execu ted earlier and not from the 
execu tion of the earlier authorisation which is 
28/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
execu ted later. This anomalous situation is 
intended to be removed by insertion of 
Explanation 2 below section 158BE with effect 
from July 1, 1995, by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 
1998. This Explanation reads as follows:
‘Explanation 2. —For the removal of doubts, it 
is hereby declared that the authorisation 
referred to in sub-section (1) shall be deemed 
to have been execu ted, —
(a) in the case of search, on the conclusion of 
search as recorded in the last panchnama 
drawn in relation to any person in whose case 
the warrant of authorisation has been issued;
(b) in the case of requisition under section 
132A, on the actual receipt of the books of 
account or other documents or assets by the 
authorised officer.’
According to this Explanation, limitation is to be 
counted with reference to the last panchnama 
drawn on execu tion of a warrant of 
authorisation as referred to in section 158BE. 
The main attribute of the panchnama is stated 
to be that it should record the conclusion of 
search.”
80.The law does not contemplate the 
authorised officer to set out in any of the 
panchnama that he has finally concluded the 
29/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
search. If for any reason the authorised officer 
wants to search the premises again, it could be 
done by obtaining a fresh authorisation. There 
is no prohibition in respect of the same 
premises. It is open to the empowered 
authority to issue authorisation but when the 
authorisation is issued once, the authorised 
officer cannot go on visiting the premises under 
the guise of search. Therefore, it is clear once 
in pursuance of an authorisation issued the 
search commences, it comes to an end with the 
drawing of a panchnama. When the authorised 
officer enters the premises, normally, the 
panchnama is written when he comes out of the 
premises after completing the job entrusted to 
him. Even if after such search he visits the 
premises again, for investigation or inspection 
of the subject-matter of restraint order or 
prohibitory order, if a panchnama is written, 
that would not be the panchnama which has to 
be looked into for the purpose of computing the 
period of limitation. But, such a panchnama 
would only record what transpires on a re-visit 
to the premises and the incriminating material 
seized would become part of the search 
conducted in pursuance of the authorisation and 
would become the subject-matter of block 
30/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
assess ment proceedings. But, such a 
panchnama would not extend the period of 
limitation. It is because the limitation is 
prescribed under the statute. If proceedings are 
not initiated within the time prescribed, the 
remedy is lost. The assessee  would acquire a 
valuable right. Such a right cannot be at the 
mercy of the officials, who do not discharge 
their duties in accordance with law. The 
procedure prescribed under section 132 of the 
Act is elaborate and exhaustive. The said 
substantive provision expressly provides for 
search and seizure. In the entire provision there 
is no indication of that search once commenced 
can be postponed. What can be postponed is 
only seizure of the articles. Therefore, once 
search commences it has to come to an end 
with the search party leaving the premises 
whether any seizure is made or not. The 
limitation for completion of block assessm ent is 
expressly provided under section 158BE which 
clearly declares that it is the execu tion of the 
last of authorisation which is to be taken into 
consideration. The word “seizure” is 
conspicuously missing in the said section. The 
same cannot be read into the section for the 
purpose of limitation. Then it amounts to 
31/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
rewriting the section by the court, which is 
impermissible in law. 
81. The aforesaid Circular No. 772, dated 
Decem ber 23, 1998 (see [1999] 235 ITR (St.) 
35) refers to this dilemma faced by the 
Department.
“127. Execution of last of the authorisation or 
requisition
The word ‘execu te’ is defined in Black's Law 
Dictionary, fifth edition, page 509 as follows:
‘to complete; to make; to sign; to perform; to 
do; to carry out according to its terms; to follow 
up; to fulfil the command or purpose of; to 
perform all necessa ry formalities; to make and 
sign a contract; to sign and deliver a notes.’
The word ‘execu tion’ is defined at page 510 of 
the said Law Dictionary as follows:
‘Carry out some act or course of conduct to its 
completion. Northwest Steel Rolling Mills v. 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, C.C.A. 
Wash., 110 F. 2d 286, 290: completion of an 
act: putting into force: completion fulfilment: 
perfecting of anything or carrying it into 
operation and effect. “Execution” a process in 
action to carry into effect the directions in a 
decree or judgment—Foust v. Foust, 47 Cal. 2d 
121, 302 p. 2d 11, 13.’
32/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
In the light of the above definition of the words 
‘execu te’ and ‘execu tion’, one may argue that 
until and unless the final act is performed, the 
warrant of authorisation should not be treated 
as execu ted and the mere initiation of the 
search followed by an interregnum consequent 
upon restraint order or for any other reason 
may not be treated as ‘execu tion’ of the 
warrant. But this interpretation would be 
hypertechnical and it needs detailed discussion 
as is done in the following paras.
The question arises as to whether execu tion of 
a warrant of authorisation or requisition refers 
to the conclusion of the proceedings under 
section 132 and/or 132A or it refers only to the 
execu tion of the warrant even though as a 
result of such execu tion the proceedings under 
section 132 or 132A are yet to he completed. 
The latter situation will include a case in which 
a restraint order under section 132(3) is 
passed. In such a case, it can be said that 
though the warrant of authorisation has been 
execu ted, proceedings under section 132(3) are 
pending. Since the word ‘execu te’, also means 
‘to complete’, one has to wait for conclusion of 
the proceedings under section 132(3) for the 
purpose of computation of limitation under 
33/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
section 158BE(1) and the period of one year 
has to be computed from the end of the month 
in which the proceeding under section 132(3) 
are concluded. If there are more than one 
warrant limitation will be counted from the 
execu tion of the last one.
A contrary view is as much possible if one were 
to consider the spirit of the scheme which 
envisages expeditious disposal of the search 
cases and it would be reasonable to interpret 
that execu tion of warrant is not tantamount to 
completion of proceedings under section 132 or 
132A the period during which the proceedings 
under section 132(3) remained pending has to 
be excluded for the purpose of counting 
limitation of one or two years under section 
158BE. Otherwise, it may lead to absurd results 
as it may take several years before restraint 
under section 132(3) is lifted and it may thus 
extend the period of one or two years by all 
those years during which proceedings under 
section 132(3) remained pending it may be 
agreed against this view that section 132(8A) 
takes care that there is no extension of 
proceedings under section 132(3) and that the 
view can-, not be taken without doing violence 
to the language of the Act.”
34/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
82.Therefore, the Explanation added to remove 
a doubt cannot be construed, as a provision 
providing a longer period of limitation than the 
one prescribed in the main section. When under 
the scheme of the section there is no indication 
of a second search on the basis of the same 
authorisation issued under the said provision, 
the legislative intention is clear and plain and 
the interpretation to be placed by the courts 
should be in harmony with such an intention. 
Therefore, one authorisation is to be issued in 
respect of one premises in pursuance of which 
there can be only one search and such a search 
is concluded, when the searching party comes 
out of the premises, which is evidenced by 
drawing up a panchnama. When there are 
multiple places to search and when multiple 
authorisations are issued, on different dates or 
on the same date or in respect of the same 
premises more than one authorisation is issued 
on different dates, the last panchnama drawn in 
proof of conclusion of search in respect of the 
authorisation is to be taken into consideration 
for the purpose of limitation for block 
assess ment."

W.P.No.20999 of 2003
37. The said position of C.Ramaiah Reddy case was in fact 
accepted by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of A.Rakesh 
Kumar Jain v. Joint Commis sioner of Income tax reported in 
(2012) 254 CTC 0576 : (2012) 80 DTR 0257 and in order to 
understand the said decision, the relevant portion of the said Judgment 
is extracted hereunder :
"11. Before going into the merits of the 
contention, sub-clause (1) of  Section158BE 
reads as under:
“Time limit for completion of block assessm ent 
158BE (1). The order under Section 158BC 
shall be passed—[a) within one year from the 
end of the month in which the last of the 
authorisations for search under s. 132 or for 
requisition under s. 132A as the case may be, 
was execu ted in cases where a search is 
initiated or books of account or other 
documents or any assets are requisitioned 
after the 30th June 1995, but before the 1st 
Jan., 1997;
(b) within two years from the end of the month 
in which the last of the authorisations for 
search under s. 132 or for requisition under s. 
132A, as the case may be, was execu ted in 
cases where a search is initiated or books of 
36/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
account or other documents, or any assets are 
requisitioned on or after the 1st day of 
January, 1997.”
A reading of the above section shows that it 
consciously takes note of the cases of more 
than one authorisation for search issued. In 
such cases, the Explanation provided for the 
deemed conclusion to the execu tion of the 
warrant as extended to the last of the 
Panchanamas in relation to the person, in 
whose case authorisation was issued. But, 
could the Explanation be extended to a case of 
single authorisation issued but with 
Panchanamas of more than one drawn?
12. We do not subscribe to the view of the 
Revenue based on the Explanation that several 
of the authorisations drawn and execu ted on 
different dates and the several Panchanamas 
drawn would have bearing to a case of single 
authorisation for search, but showing several 
Panchanamas. In this connection, reasoning of 
the Karnataka High Court in the case of C. 
Ramaiah Reddy (cited supra) in paragraph 77 
would be of relevance.
The Panchnama referred to in Explanation  2 to 
the said section specifically refers to search 
under Section 132 and Section 132 specifically 
37/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
refers to authorisation to enter and search and 
it has no reference to entering and searching 
the premises which are the subject-matter of 
prohibitory order or restraint order. No 
authorisation is required to enter the premises 
and inspect the materials which are the 
subject-matter of prohibitory order or restraint 
order. The said order itself acts as an 
authorisation to enter the premises and inspect 
the materials which are the subject-matter of 
those orders and it also empower them to 
seize any incriminating material. However, 
after entering the premises of such person, he 
has to confine his actions only for inspection of 
the subject-matter of prohibitory order or 
restraint order. He cannot search the premises 
over again. Any material seized after such 
inspection would be the undisclosed income for 
the purpose of the block assessm ent in 
pursuance of search under s. 132(1) of the 
Act. The Panchnama evidencing such 
inspection and seizure would be the last 
Panchnama in respect of the said premises. 
But for the purpose of limitation under Section 
158BE, it would not be the last Panchnama 
drawn in proof of conclusion of search, as 
defined in Explanation 2 to  Section 158BE. For 
38/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
the purpose of limitation, there can be only 
one search and one Panchnama.”
13. As reasoned out therein, there could be 
only one authorisation and a Panchanama 
drawn as regards the conduct of the search, 
i.e., once when the search party concluded the 
search and leaves the premises after carrying 
with them the seized material, the 
authorisation for the search is fully 
implemented upon and execu tion completed. 
There afterwards, if the Department has to 
enter the premises again, as by way of search, 
certainly, one requires fresh authorisation; 
however, as stated by the Karnataka High 
Court, no such authorisation is required to 
enter the premises to inspect the materials, 
which are the subject-matter of prohibitory 
order or restraint order. The said order itself 
acts as an authorisation to enter the premises 
and inspect the materials, which are the 
subject-matter of those orders. However, after 
entering the premises of such person, he has 
to confine his actions only for inspection of the 
subject-matter of prohibitory order or restraint 
order. He cannot search the premises over 
again. Any material seized after such 
inspection would be the undisclosed income for 
39/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
the purpose of the block assessm ent in 
pursuance of search under s. 132(1) of the 
Act. Thus, the Panchanama evidencing such 
inspection and seizure would be the last 
Panchanama in respect of the said premises. 
But for the purpose of limitation under s. 
158BE, it would not be the last Panchanama 
drawn in proof of conclusion of search, as 
defined in Explanation 2 to Section158BE. For 
the purpose of limitation, there can be only 
one search and one Panchnama as reasoned 
out by the Karnataka High Court. 
14. Referring to the Kerala High Court decision 
in the case of Dr. C. Balakrishna Nair v. CIT, 
(1999) 237 ITR 70 (Ker), the Karnataka High 
Court held that there is no provision in the 
Criminal Procedure Code or in the Income Tax 
Act therein, for postponing the search for such 
a long period. It is worthwhile to extract the 
decision of the Karnataka High Court, which in 
clear terms brings out the concept of search 
and validity of the authorisation issued for the 
search.
“Similarly, in circumstances not covered under 
those provisions, it is open for him to pass a 
prohibitory order under sub-section (3) not 
amounting to seizure which order will be in 
40/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
force for a period of 60 days after securing the 
possess ion of the materials, articles etc., in the 
aforesaid manner. Action under Section 132(3) 
of the Income Tax Act can be resorted to only 
if there is any practical difficulty in seizing the 
item which is liable to be seized. When there is 
no such practical difficulty the officer is left 
with no other alternative but to seize the item, 
if he is of the view that it represented 
undisclosed income. Power under Section 
132(1)(iii) of the Income Tax Act thus cannot 
be exercised, so as to circumvent the 
provisions of Section 132(1)(iii) r/w Section 
132(1)(v) of the Income Tax Act. It is open for 
the authorised officer to visit the place for the 
purpose of investigation securing further 
particulars. Under the scheme, the law 
provides for such procedure. But not when he 
visits the premises for further investigation for 
the materials already secured. It does not 
amount to search as the materials to be looks 
into and investigated is already known and is 
the subject-matter of a prohibitory order or a 
restraint order. Though it is not seizure or 
deemed seizure, it amounts to deemed 
possess ion. What is in your possession is to be 
looked into to find out, is there any 
41/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
incriminating material. It does not amount to 
search as understood under Section 132 of the 
Act. It is only because of paucity of time he 
has gone back and wants to come back and 
look into the matter leisurely. There is no 
provision in the Criminal Procedure Code or in 
the Income-tax Act or the Rules for postponing 
the search for a long period. Then, the concept 
of search as understood either under the 
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code or 
the Act which are made applicable expressly, 
would lose its meaning.”
15. As already seen, merely because, more 
than one Panchanama is drawn in the given 
case on one authorisation, one cannot construe 
that the subsequent and the last of the 
Panchanama issued as one flowing out of the 
search as a last of the Panchanama referable 
to Explanation 2 to Section 158BE. Once the 
warrant of authorisation has been issued and 
the premises is searched and the search party 
leaves the premises, there is the end of the 
search and what could be postponed is only 
seizure of the articles and issuance of 
prohibitory order; however, limitation for the 
completion of the block assess ment begins on 
the conclusion of the search and issuance of 
42/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
Panchanama and in case of single 
authorisation, the moment such party leaves 
the premises by drawing of the Panchanama 
noting conclusion of the search, the limitation 
period begins.
16. Going by the facts herein, viz., as to the 
search completed on 13.12.2001 with drawing 
of the Panchanama and the search party 
leaving the premises, the mere fact that the 
Panchanama contains the observation that 
“search continues” per se would not enable the 
search party to keep the search in a suspended 
animation to carry on the search in future date 
to contend that the limitation has to be worked 
out on the last Panchanama drawn i.e., 
15.02.2002, thus calculating the limitation 
from 15.02.2002. We have no hesitation in 
accepting the case of the assessee  that the 
limitation ends on 31.12.2002. The contention 
of the Revenue that the limitation has to be 
taken as 29.02.2004 does not go with the 
provisions of the Act. In such circumstances, 
the tax case appeal is allowed. Accordingly, we 
set aside the order of the Tribunal. No costs."
43/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
38. These two decisions have been heavily relied upon by the 
learned counsel appearing for the petitioner / assessee  and he would 
contend that, there must be one authorisation and one panchanama 
for one search in one premises and once the search is over, thereafter 
if at all any prohibitory order under Section 132(3) is issued, such 
prohibitory order can only be used as an authorisation for the Revenue 
to re-enter the premises only for the purpose of seizure of the 
documents and materials and not for continuation of search. In other 
words, once authorisation is issued and search was conducted and the 
team of search left the premises after the drawal of panchanama, then 
the search operation is over and thereafter the only business left to 
the Revenue team to come back to the premises is for the purpose of 
seizure of the documents under the strength of prohibitory order since 
the prohibitory order issued in this regard would itself act as an 
authorisation for re-entry to the premises for the purpose of seizure 
and not for the purpose of further continuation of search by the 
Revenue team without a further authorisation.
39. Only in this context, the Karnataka High Court in Ramaiah 
Reddy (cited supra) followed by a Division Bench of this Court in 
Rakesh Kumar Jain (cited supra), held that, only in case of more than 
44/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
one authorisation what shall be the last authorisation or pursuant to 
what shall be the last panchanama of the last authorisation shall be 
treated as the last authorisation for the purpose of starting point of the 
limitation under Section 158BE(1)(b) and in case of one authorisation 
with multiple panchanamas, it cannot be said that, the last such 
panchanama drawn by the Revenue under one authorisation would be 
the starting point of the limitation as that has not been intended in 
Explanation 2 referred to above. This was exactly held by the aforesaid 
two decisions.
40. However, Mr.A.P.Srinivas, learned standing counsel 
appearing for the Revenue has relied upon Deputy Commissioner of 
Income-Tax, Central Circle II(1) v. Rakesh Sarin, reported in 
(2014) 222 Taxman 84 (Madras) : (2014) 362 ITR 619 
(Madras), which is a decision subsequently made by a Division Bench 
of this Court after Ramaiah Reddy and Rakesh Kumar Jain cases. In 
this Judgment, the Division Bench has held as follows :
"12... As is evident from the reading of the provision 
to Section 158BE of the Act, in the case of search 
conducted after 01.01.1996, it was declared that 
limitation for passing the order under Section 158BE 
of the Act is given as 2 years from the end of the 
45/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
month in which last of the authorisation was 
executed. Explanation 2 clarifies "the authorisation 
referred to in Sub Section (1) shall be deemed to have 
been executed (a) in the case of search, on the 
conclusion of search as recorded in the last 
panchanama drawn in relation to any person in 
whose case the warrant of authorisation has been 
issued." Therefore, for finding out the limitation, all 
that is required to be seen is as to what is the last 
panchanama drawn in relation to the assessee, in 
whose case, warrant of authorisation was issued. 
13. It is seen from the facts stated that the 
authorisation was issued by the Department on 
26.03.2003 under Section 132 of the Act to search 
the residential and office premises of the assessee. In 
terms of the said authorisation, the premises was 
searched on 27.03.2003 and 28.03.2003. In the 
panchanama drawn on 27.03.2003 and 28.03.2003, 
copies of which have been filed in the typed set of 
papers, it is seen that the Officer has recorded as 
".search continues". (temporarily concluded). 
Thereafter, we find that another authorisation was 
issued on 27.08.2003 under Section 132 of the Act to 
search the Bank, in which the assessee held his 
account and lockers. Pursuant to such authorisation, 
a panchanama was drawn on 28.08.2003, wherein, 
search was commenced on 28.08.2003 at 11.15 a.m., 
and concluded on 29.08.2003 at 12.05 p.m. In terms 
46/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
of the panchanama, the search concluded on 
29.08.2003. In an unreported decision in Tax Case 
(Appeal).No.1240 of 2006, by order dated 
25.09.2012 (A.Rakesh Kumar Jain Vs.  Jt. CIT (2013) 
214 Taxman 39), this Court considered the similar 
question on limitation under Section 158 BE of the 
Act.
14. A reading of the decision of the Karnataka High 
Court in the case of C.Ramaiah Reddy v. Asst. CIT 
(2011) 339 ITR210(Karn), wherein, heavy reliance 
was placed by the assessee clearly point out that the 
limitation in the case, where, the prohibitory order 
was issued following the search and panchanama was 
drawn, the same could be worked out not with 
reference to the date of the prohibitory order, but 
with reference to the panchanama drawn in proof of 
conclusion of search, as defined in Explanation 2 to 
Section 158BE of the Act. Applying the said decision 
of the Karnataka High Court reported in the case of 
C.Ramaiah Reddy (supra), this Court decided a 
similar question in the unreported decision in Tax 
Case (Appeal).No.1240 of 2006 dated 25.09.2012 
(A.Rakesh Kumar Jain (supra)). In such 
circumstances, we do not find that there is any 
justification to accept the plea of the assessee to 
confirm the order of learned Single Judge.
47/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
15. Learned counsel appearing for the assessee 
pointed out that in any extent, there is only one 
search, therefore, limitation has to be worked out 
taking the search conducted on 27.03.2003 as the 
date where the last panchanama was drawn; if the 
Revenue had any case, whatever be the annexures to 
the contents of the panchanama in the second search, 
it is open for the Revenue to make such of the 
assessment based on the materials covered in the 
course of second search. In the circumstances, the 
assessment fails in this case.
16. We do no accept the above said line of submission 
of learned counsel for the assessee. As already 
pointed out in the preceding paragraphs, in cases 
where there is more than one authorisation, the 
starting point of limitation is to be computed from 
the last of the authorisation which as per Explanation 
2 to Sub Section 2 of Section 158 BE of the Act is 
deemed to have been executed on the conclusion of 
the search as recorded in the last panchanama 
drawn. Thus going by Explanation 2 added by the 
Finance (No.2) Act, 1998 with retrospective effect 
from 1.07.1995, the contention of the assessee cannot 
be accepted. Thus, with every panchanama drawn, 
the search team leaving the premises, the search 
conducted on 28.03.2003 came to an end as far as 
that authorisation was concerned. However the 
48/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
second search was admittedly on a fresh 
authorisation. Thus, in respect of search conducted 
on 27.03.2003 and 28.03.2003, panchanama was 
drawn with observation ".search continues"., thus, 
considering the fact that the second search was to be 
carried on the different premises and materials to be 
seized, in fitness of things, fresh authorisation was 
issued by the Department on 27.08.2003 and as such 
under Section 158BE of the Act, limitation has to be 
worked out from that date, i.e., the end of the month 
of 28.08.2003 and not with reference to the first 
search i.e., 27.03.2003 and 28.03.2003.
17. In the background of this, we do not accept the 
plea of the assessee to uphold the order of learned 
Single Judge that the assessment is barred by 
limitation. Consequently, the Writ Appeal is allowed, 
the order of learned Single Judge is set aside. Thus, 
the Revenue succeeds on the aspect of limitation as 
regards the assessment made in this case."
41. This Judgment has been heavily relied upon by the learned 
standing counsel for the Revenue and who would submit that, the 
Division Bench of this Court in Rakesh Sarin's case (cited supra), 
where one of the member of the Division Bench of this Court was the 
member of the earlier Division Bench of this Court who authored the 
49/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
Rakesh Kumar Jain's case (cited supra), itself has distinguished the 
Rakesh Kumar Jain's case depending upon the facts of the case. 
Therefore the learned standing counsel for the Revenue would 
vehemently contend that, it is not the hard and fast rule that, the 
interpretation given to Explanation 2 to Section 158BE would be fit in 
for all circumstances and all cases falling under the category of Section 
158BE(1)(b).
42. I have gone through all these three Judgments, i.e., one 
Division Bench of Karnataka High Court and two Division Benches of 
this Court.
43. The said interpretation given in respect of Explanation 2 
referred to above of Section 158BE, as has been rightly contended by 
the learned standing counsel appearing for the Revenue, cannot be 
applied in respect of all cases in all circumstances and situations falling 
under Section 158BE(1)(b). 
44. In the case in hand, though the authorisation and first search 
was made on 25.01.2001 and the first panchanama was drawn on 
25.01.2001 for two separate premises of the petitioner, for which two 
50/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
separate authorisation had been made, in respect of one premises, 
i.e., at No.23, Noor Veeraswamy Street, Chennai - 34, the Revenue 
concluded the search on the very first day itself and this is evident 
from the panchanama issued in that premises, dated 25.01.2001. 
Therefore on the said premises, there was no prohibitory order and no 
further search was made.  
45. However in so far as the second premises, i.e., at No.4/181, 
Kodambakkam High Road, Chennai - 34 is concerned, where also the 
search was conducted on 25.01.2001 first time, in the panchanama 
dated 25.01.2001, the Revenue has made it clear that, "the search 
continues", therefore they issued the prohibitory order. 
46. In this context, by relying upon the interpretation given in 
the two Division Bench Judgments referred to above in Ramaiah Reddy 
and Rajesh Kumar Jain cases, the learned counsel appearing for the 
petitioner would insist that, merely because prohibitory order was 
issued, under that pretext, the time for search cannot be extended 
under the same authorisation by drawing sever al panchanamas on 
sever al dates and therefore the subsequent search taken place in the 
second premises of the petitioner without any specific authorisation 
51/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
was unauthorised, therefore, for the purpose of limitation, the one and 
only panchanama, dated 25.01.2001 alone shall be taken into 
consideration.
47. However the factual matrix of this case would reveal that, 
though the search was made by the Revenue team on 25.01.2001, the 
search was inconclusive at No.4/181, Kodambakkam High Road, 
Chennai-34, therefore at the panchanama, dated 25.01.2001, it was 
recorded as "search continues", and prohibitory order was issued. 
Even thereafter, sever al occasions when the search continued, it could 
not be completed or concluded for the peculiar and specific reason in 
the present case that, number of documents required by the Revenue 
had been uploaded in the electronic system, i.e., Computer and those 
documents could not be accessed  by the Revenue. In this context, the 
word "search" as has been employed, could be understood with a 
connotation as contemplated under the provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure 1973, relating to search and seizure.
48. In this context Section 132 of the Act deals with Search and 
seizure, wherein 132 (1) (iib) reads thus :
"(iib) require any person who is found to be in 
52/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
possess ion or control of any books of account 
or other documents maintained in the form of 
electronic record as defined in clause (t) of sub-
section (1) of section 2 of the Information 
Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000), to afford 
the authorised officer the necessa ry facility to 
inspect such books of account or other 
documents."
49. This clause (iib) was inserted by the Finance Act, 2002 w.e.f. 
01.06.2002. Having in mind of this clause (iib), if we look at the hurdle 
faced by the Revenue in the present case when they undertook the 
search operation in the second premises of the petitioner, the Revenue 
has disclosed those aspect in the counter affidavit, which are relevant 
to be taken note of. Hence the relevant portion of the counter to that 
effect are extracted hereunder :
"I state that from the records, on 30.01.2001 
some books and documents were seized after 
verification. Prohibitory orders were placed as 
the search could not be completed. The 
volume of books and documents to be seen 
were huge. They related to various assessees 
of the group and to various years. The search 
operations were conducted on the basis of 
valid warrant of authorisation issued by the 
53/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
DIT (Inv), Chennai. The search operations 
continued till 25.06.2001 preciously because of 
the reason that the petitioner did not provide 
the password in respect of files contained in 
the computers and also voluminous books of 
account found during the course of 
proceedings. The prohibitory order were issued 
on various occasions in view of the non 
completion of the search on the respective 
dates but not for the purpose of harassing the 
petitioner. As such there is no truth in the 
allegation that search proceedings were 
invalid.
I state that because more time was required to 
go through the contents of the computers and 
the books, in order to verify their contents, it 
was necessa ry to place prohibitory orders and 
to continue the search. There was no intention 
of harassing the petitioner. All the rooms which 
were prohibited also contained computer(s) 
which contained password protected files. The 
petitioner did not divulge the password 
throughout the continuation of the search 
proceedings. This can be seen from the sworn 
statements recorded from the petitioner. In 
the  absence  of  the  passwords, access  to the
54/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
password protected files were denied and 
verification work could not be done speedily. 
They had to be ultimately seized. This utter 
non-cooperation on the part of the petitioner 
only delayed the conclusion of the search 
proceedings. There was no intention of 
harassing the petitioner as alleged by the 
petitioner."
50. Therefore it is a factual matrix that, throughout the series of 
search undertaken by the Revenue from January 2001 till June 2001, 
the password of the computer of the petitioner / assessee  to have 
access  with the documents loaded or fed in, in the computer, had not 
been divulged by the petitioner and these factor had not been denied 
by the petitioner. If that being so, it cannot be said that, the Revenue 
without having access  to the electronic documents should have 
completed their search on the very first day of the search, dated 
25.01.2001 itself. 
51. Only in order to meet these kind of situations, the aforesaid 
clause (iib), extracted above, was inserted by the legislature from 
01.06.2002, therefore unless and until the necessa ry facility, to 
inspect such books of account or other documents maintained in the 
55/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
form of electronic record, is made available to the Revenue, it cannot 
be said that, the search was completed, instead, it should only be 
construed that, the search continues.
52. Here in the case in hand, exactly this situation was 
confronted by the Revenue and that is the reason why they continued 
the search on sever al days and ultimately only in June 2001, the 
Revenue seem s to have been able to get the password or facility to 
have access to the electronic documents of the petitioner / assessee 
and thereafter only they concluded the search and further proceedings 
continued. 
53. Therefore, no doubt, in general, the interpretation given in 
the two Division Bench Judgments, namely Ramaiah Reddy and 
Rakesh Kumar Jain (cited supra), with respect, is to be followed. 
However, the said interpretation cannot be fit in, in the facts of the 
present case, in view of the provision, namely clause (iib) of Section 
132(1). Therefore within the said provision of (iib) referred to above, it 
can only be construed that, the search operation commences at the 
second premises of the petitioner on 25.01.2001, continued till 
12.06.2001, therefore each time separate panchanamas were drawn 
56/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
and prohibitory orders were issued with the endorsement that, "search 
continues". However it has been misquoted by the petitioner that, 
even though the panchanama, dated 25.01.2001 discloses with an 
endorsement of the Revenue that, the "search concluded", subsequent 
issuance of prohibitory order and on that strength, subsequent 
searches made till 12.06.2001 was unauthorised. However the fact 
remains that, in the second premises the search continued and in view 
of the specific provisions referred to above in Section 132(1)(iib), 
which, even  though came into effect only from 01.06.2002, the 
continuous search went up to 12.06.2001 can very well said to be 
authorised and therefore the Revenue cannot be found fault with by 
compelling them to calculate the limitation within the meaning of 
Section 158BE(1)(b) from 01.02.2001 by taking into account the 
panchanama, dated 25.01.2001 as the last panchanama and by not 
taking the 12.06.2001 panchanama as the last panchanama.
54. Therefore independently, on the basis of Section 132(1)(iib), 
the Revenue's continuous search operation taken place on various 
dates from 25.01.2001 till 12.06.2001 can very well be construed as 
an authorised search operation, therefore the panchanama issued on 
12.06.2001 shall be deemed to be the last authorisation within the 
meaning of Explanation 2 to Section 158BE.
57/60
http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.20999 of 2003
55. If that being the position, the  impugned Block Assess ment 
Order, dated 30.06.2003 is within the limitation of two years under 
Section 158BE(1)(b) commencing from 01.07.2001 since the end of 
the month in which the last of authorisation for search under Section 
132 was to be reckoned only as 30.06.2001.
56. In view of these peculiar facts and circumstances of the case 
and in view of the discussion made above, the ground raised by the 
petitioner side in the context of Section 158BE(1)(b) to state that, the 
impugned order is barred by limitation, is unsustainable.
57. For all these reasons stated above and for the legal position 
discussed above, this Court is of the considered view that, the 
impugned Block Assessm ent Order, dated 30.06.2003 cannot be said 
to be defective for want of limitation, within the meaning of Section 
158BE(1)(b) of the Act and also the other reasons and grounds urged 
by the petitioner side since cannot be said to be the advancing factor 
of the petitioner's case, this Court feel that, the impugned order can 
very well be sustained, that means, on the grounds urged by the 
petitioner, it cannot be successf ully assailed.
Resultantly, the writ petition fails, hence, it is dismissed.
